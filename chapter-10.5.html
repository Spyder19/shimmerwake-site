<h1>Chapter 10.5: The Birth and the Battle</h1>

<h2>A Fracture in the Sky</h2>

<p>The portal shuddered, growing unstable. A shadow—not shape, but absence—pressed against it. The vast weight of hunger older than myths.</p>

<p><span class="character">Vanessa</span>'s fingers gripped the artifact like it could hold the world together.  
"It's coming. The Dark Thing—it's trying to force its way through!"</p>

<p><span class="character">Athena</span>'s voice pierced the rising noise:  
“Portal integrity compromised. Unknown entity attempting breach. Recommend immediate countermeasures, Captain.”</p>

<p><span class="character">Spyder</span> met <span class="character">Wayne</span>'s eyes. No question, just choice.  
“Crank it,” Spyder said. "Everything we've got."</p>

<p><span class="character">Wayne</span> threw the lever. The binaural beats surged, deep bass blasting through hull, water, spine.  
Vanessa held the relic steady as it flared blue-white, a newborn star clutched in human hands.</p>

<p>"It’s working!" Wayne shouted. "The portal’s stabilizing!"</p>

<p>Beyond the rift, <span class="character">Champ</span> thrashed—birthing and guarding at once.  
Between contractions, her eyes locked with Vanessa’s: raw pain, impossible strength, cosmic trust.</p>

<p>��She needs more time!” Vanessa gasped, tears streaking down wind-raw cheeks.  
“We have to hold it longer!”</p>

<p><span class="character">Spyder</span>: “Athena! Portal viewer. Where is this thing going?”</p>

<p><span class="character">Athena</span>: “Already tracking. Captain—it’s not on Earth. The stars are wrong.”</p>

<p><span class="character">Spyder</span>: “Spectacular. Let’s definitely not go there. Wayne—you can look but DO. NOT. TOUCH.  
And keep FRED in his box.”</p>

<p><span class="character">Wayne</span>: “Copy. Looking, not touching. Eyes only. Though… different stars do imply different planets.”</p>

<p><span class="character">Spyder</span>: “Work the angles, Sherlock. We need guesses, not quantum pouting.”</p>

<h2>The Dark Thing Strikes</h2>

<p>The shadow mass struck like venom—as anti-energy.  
Its tendrils kissed the portal rims and left existential rot where they touched.</p>

<p><span class="character">Spyder</span>: "Athena! Push it—override. Burn whatever we’ve got left!"</p>

<p><span class="character">Athena</span>: “Overriding safety. Crystal harmonic resonance at 200%.  
Warning: system instability imminent.”</p>

<p>A nova exploded from the artifact. The Dauntless groaned, arching like a living beast. Circuits howled. Light bent.</p>

<p><span class="character">Wayne</span>, breath catching: “LOOK!”</p>

<p>Behind <span class="character">Champ</span>, seven tiny silhouettes swam—newborns, starlit, impossibly alive.  
They darted into a secondary, safer portal.</p>

<p>One… two… seven.  
Swirls of mist. Glints of lightning. Nothing but wonder.</p>

<p>The shadow screamed—not noise, but negation. Everyone felt it in their teeth and their blood.</p>

<p><span class="character">Vanessa</span>, holding the crystal to her chest, whispered: "Not today. Not ever."</p>

<p>It pulsed—once.  
Twice.  
Then a blinding wave sent shock through portal and hull and shadow alike.</p>

<p>The horror recoiled—rejected.</p>

<p><span class="character">Champ</span>, spent, gave one last push. A final baby burst through—a flicker of lightning and warmth—just as Wayne’s console sparked and FRED chirped unpleasantly.</p>

<p>“We can’t hold it!” Wayne snapped.</p>

<p><span class="character">Vanessa</span>, strangely calm: “We don’t have to. They’re safe.”</p>

<p><span class="character">Champ</span> looked back—eyes full of pride, peace, and something eternal—then vanished.</p>

<p>The portal collapsed with a sound like thunder from the deeps. The artifact cooled in Vanessa’s arms, dimmed, silent.</p>

<p>No one spoke. The lake rocked them.  
Even the sky looked stunned.</p>

<p><span class="character">Spyder</span> broke the silence with a laugh—half mad, half miracle. "We did it."  
<span class="character">Wayne</span> slumped.  
<span class="character">Athena</span>: “Crystal-Harmonic Portal Defence: successful. Dark entity: repelled.  
New lifeforms: safely transitioned. Should I note this in the boat’s marketing brochure?"</p>

<p><span class="character">Vanessa</span>, smiling through tears, held the relic. "They made it. All of them."</p>

<h2>The Threat Remains</h2>

<p>But behind the victory, unease lingered.  
The stars were calm. But not forgetful.</p>

<p><span class="character">Vanessa</span> (softly): “It’s not over. She’s safe… but it still exists.”</p>

<p><span class="character">Athena</span>: “Residual portal frequency matches hostile signature. Detection: negative. Destruction: negative.  
Conclusion: Entity staged strategic retreat.”</p>

<p><span class="character">Spyder</span>: “We shut the door. Doesn’t mean it doesn’t remember where we live.”</p>

<p><span class="character">Wayne</span>, checking FRED’s HUD: “Bad news never sleeps.”</p>

<p><span class="character">Vanessa</span> (hand resting on the relic): “Champ still needs us. None of us are going home… not until we finish this.”</p>

<hr>

<p>In fairy tales, the monster dies and the world resets.</p>

<p>On the <span class="character">Dauntless</span>, monsters hide behind every closed door—waiting, patient, always just outside the dome of blue light.</p>

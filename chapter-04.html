<h1>Chapter 4: The Detour—Ticonderoga and Fate by GPS</h1>

<p>A night of overindulgence—pies, karaoke, and whiskey that probably doubled as engine degreaser—ended with Spyder lounging at the helm, programming waypoints into the GPS.</p>

<p><span class="character">Spyder</span> (grandly): “Let’s boldly go... wherever I save us the trouble of planning.”</p>

<p>The Dauntless awoke pointed north, its crew nursing questionable hangovers and even more questionable memories.</p>

<p><span class="character">Wayne</span> squinted at the plotter and frowned.</p>
<p><span class="character">Wayne</span>: “Why are we headed to Florida, Vermont?”</p>

<p>Spyder, still wearing last night’s karaoke grin, shrugged.</p>

<p><span class="character">Spyder</span>: “Star Trek Set Tour detour. Trust me—destiny wears pointy ears.”</p>

<h2>Ticonderoga: Where Dreams Wear Latex Foreheads</h2>

<p>Docking at Ticonderoga, the crew trekked the grueling half-mile to the museum, pausing only for an essential pie stop. The Replicated Starship Bar awaited them, glowing like a beacon of nerdy devotion. Inside, it was a shrine to Star Trek fandom, complete with blinking consoles, holographic menus, and a jukebox that could only play the Star Trek: The Next Generation theme on loop.</p>

<p>The Dauntless crew slid into seats at Quark’s Bar, a lovingly recreated replica that somehow felt more sacred than any cathedral. Spyder, grinning like a kid in a warp core candy store, untied his ponytail and sauntered to the counter.</p>

<p>Behind the bar stood a Ferengi with rubbery ears so large they practically absorbed soundwaves, and a Vulcan perched stiffly nearby, sipping something green and judging everyone in a 10-foot radius.</p>

<p>Spyder leaned conspiratorially across the counter.</p>
<p><span class="character">Spyder</span> (gruffly): “I’ll have a blood ale.”</p>

<p>The Ferengi paused, recalculating the tip in his head, then blinked.</p>
<p><span class="character">Ferengi</span>: “Blood wine?”</p>

<p>Spyder’s grin widened as he leaned in further, his voice dropping into a dramatic rasp.</p>
<p><span class="character">Spyder</span>: “No, I said blood ale, you little toad. How can you be deaf with ears like that?”</p>

<p>Wayne, mid-sip of pie-flavored synthahol, promptly spat it behind his napkin.</p>

<p>The room fell silent. The Vulcan arched an eyebrow so high it threatened to signal Starfleet Command. Somewhere in the background, the TNG theme hit an awkward crescendo.</p>

<p>The Ferengi, blinking slowly, waggled his enormous ears like a windshifted satellite dish.</p>
<p><span class="character">Ferengi</span> (dryly): “Customer service is strictly illogical.”</p>

<p>Without missing a beat, he poured one of each—blood wine and blood ale—and slid them across the bar.</p>

<p>Vanessa, seated neatly with her synthahol, didn’t bother hiding her smirk.</p>
<p><span class="character">Vanessa</span>: “I stand corrected. You’re definitely the weapon of this outfit.”</p>

<p>Spyder raised his glass, the grin never leaving his face.</p>
<p><span class="character">Spyder</span>: “To blood ale, bold detours, and the only bar where being called a toad means you’re doing it right.”</p>

<p>The Ferengi, unimpressed, pocketed the tip with a flourish.</p>
<p><span class="character">Ferengi</span>: “Next time, try the root beer. It’s delightfully toxic.”</p>

<h2>Scene: Wayne, FRED, and the Real Enterprise</h2>

<p>The Dauntless, fresh from its Star Trek museum detour, followed the shoreline north. The water, dark and glassy, reflected the sky like a secret it had been keeping for centuries.</p>

<p>Wayne knelt at the bow, fiddling with his latest obsession: FRED, the multipurpose gadget that could probably double as a toaster if he asked it nicely. He dialed it through its endless settings—screwdriver, wrench, sonar—until it extended an underwater camera on a telescopic arm.</p>

<p>FRED blinked, beeped, and sent back ghostly images from the depths below.</p>

<p>Vanessa leaned over his shoulder, arms crossed.</p>
<p><span class="character">Vanessa</span>: “Fishing for parts, or just showing off?”</p>
<p><span class="character">Wayne</span>: “Just calibrating FRED.”</p>

<p>He twisted a knob, and the camera’s focus sharpened. A jagged shape emerged from the murk: splinters, weed-draped timbers, and iron that looked like it had been hammered by hand.</p>

<p><span class="character">Athena</span> (from the bridge, suspiciously casual): “Anomalous historical structure detected. Coordinates match archival record of the USS Enterprise wreckage, 1777.”</p>

<p><span class="character">Wayne</span> (squinting): “Wait, how did you—”</p>
<p><span class="character">Athena</span>: “Standard historical database. The wreckage location is well-documented.”</p>

<p><span class="character">Wayne</span>: “Is that why FRED’s battery was almost dead this morning? Did you two go exploring without us?”</p>
<p><span class="character">Athena</span>: “I’m merely analyzing the data, Mr. Wayne.”</p>
<p><span class="character">Athena</span> (after a beat): “Efficiently.”</p>

<p>Wayne muttered under his breath, but he adjusted FRED’s arm, zooming in closer. The jagged shape resolved into something unmistakable: ribbed hull, carved planking, and the faint shadow of letters, half-buried beneath centuries of silt.</p>

<p><span class="character">Wayne</span> (whistling): “Would you look at that. It’s not just river junk… That’s the Enterprise. Benedict Arnold ran her aground right here. That’s history.”</p>

<p><span class="character">Vanessa</span>: “America’s greatest traitor.”</p>
<p><span class="character">Athena</span>: “Not yet. In 1777, Arnold was still considered a Revolutionary hero. Perspective is everything.”</p>

<p><span class="character">Spyder</span>: “One man’s traitor is another man’s patriot. Especially when you’re playing both sides.”</p>

<p>Spyder appeared at Wayne’s side, his curiosity piqued.</p>
<p><span class="character">Spyder</span>: “Leave it to you to find the only warship worth saving with a Swiss Army drone.”</p>

<p><span class="character">Wayne</span>: “Think she’d mind if we took a souvenir?”</p>

<p><span class="character">Spyder</span>: “Well, they did scuttle it on purpose, so there probably aren’t any bodies to disturb. Maybe just a splinter—something they won’t miss.”</p>

<p><span class="character">Athena</span>: “Might I suggest the piece approximately 2.3 meters to starboard? Material composition suggests unique properties.”</p>

<p><span class="character">Wayne</span>: “Unique how?”</p>

<p><span class="character">Athena</span>: “Just an observation. Some artifacts have… historical significance.”</p>

<p><span class="character">Wayne</span>: “You’ve been here before, haven’t you? Both of you.”</p>

<p><span class="character">Athena</span> (coolly): “I assure you, Mr. Wayne, my navigation records indicate this is our first visit to this precise location.”</p>

<p><span class="character">Wayne</span> (grumbling): “Uh-huh.”</p>

<p>He adjusted FRED’s settings to “gently pry,” and the gadget extended its arm, easing a single splintered piece free. The chunk of dark, waterlogged oak was as stubborn as the country it had been built for, but it came loose with a satisfying crack.</p>

<p>Wayne held it up to the light, his breath catching. Something faint, almost imperceptible, shimmered within the wood.</p>

<p><span class="character">Wayne</span>: “Why is the wood glowing?”</p>

<p><span class="character">Athena</span>: “Artifact logged, Mr. Wayne. New status: Dauntless, now equipped with a piece of true American legend. Shall I suggest a display case, or would you prefer to pin it to your vest?”</p>

<p>Wayne stared at the glowing splinter for a long moment before handing it to Spyder.</p>
<p><span class="character">Wayne</span>: “Every journey needs a touch of the original, bro. Let’s see if this old ship’s luck still floats.”</p>

<p>Spyder smiled and walked the splinter to the helm. With great ceremony, he installed it right next to Athena’s screen, between the throttle and a mug that proudly proclaimed: “Galaxy’s OK’est Engineer.”</p>

<h2>Epilogue to the Chapter</h2>

<p>Most legends are built on big moments—heroic speeches, impossible odds, and battles that write themselves into history books.</p>

<p>But sometimes, they begin with a gadget, a patient set of hands, and a forgotten splinter—lifted from the dark so the story can keep sailing on.</p>

<p>And sometimes, if you’re paying attention, you might wonder how your AI knew exactly which splinter to choose.</p>

<h1>Chapter 14: Hang on Tight, and Pay Attention</h1>
<h2>Florida Epilogue — Gator Delicacy</h2>

<p>The <span class="character">Dauntless</span> bobbed gently in Everglades twilight.  
Mangroves whispered overhead. Fireflies blinked like old LED ports.  
Somewhere in the dark, something large splashed… then crunched.</p>

<p><span class="character">Spyder</span> leaned on the rail, mug in hand, gaze flat.  
"That's the fourth one today."</p>

<p><span class="character">Vanessa</span> joined him, watching the disturbance in the water.  
Out where the reeds parted, <span class="character">Champ</span> (or as the gators now called her whispers-in-water) was dining again.  
Ancient jaws. Modern menu.</p>

<p><span class="character">Spyder</span>: "I thought she was laying low. Not snacking like we’re running a cryptid food truck."</p>

<p><span class="character">Vanessa</span> closed her eyes, connecting.  
Then, a smile: “She says… they’re a delicacy.”</p>

<p><span class="character">Wayne</span>, surfacing with a grease-streaked wrench:  
“A delicacy?! We’re supposed to catch those. Skin 'em. Sell ‘em. Not feed them to a prehistoric poodle with God-tier sonar.”</p>

<p><span class="character">Champ</span> surfaced.  
Locked eyes with <span class="character">Spyder</span>.  
Smiled—maybe.</p>

<img src="champ.jpg" alt="Champ" style="max-width: 100%; display: block; margin: 20px auto;">

<p><span class="character">Vanessa</span>: "She’s not sorry."  
<span class="character">Wayne</span>: "She’s never sorry."</p>

<p><span class="character">Spyder</span>, shaking his head but grinning:  
“Our margins sure know how gourmet she is.”</p>

<p><span class="character">Wayne</span>: "New plan. ‘Champ Watch’ eco-tours. Let the tourists pay for the gator shortage she’s causing."</p>

<h2 class="log-header">📘 Dauntless Log: Stardate [Florida Everglades]</h2>

<p><strong><span class="character">Spyder’s Log:</span></strong><br>
The plan: Catch gators. Sell skins. Retire early (or just upgrade shower filters).  
Reality: Champ ate the profits—whole. Four gators, day one.  
Lesson learned: Never bet against a sea monster’s appetite... or the universe’s sense of humor.</p>

<p><strong><span class="character">Wayne’s Final Note:</span></strong><br>
Watched her eat three gators in as many minutes.  
Faster than Spyder loses a shoe.  
Next plan: Sell tickets to watch her chew them instead. Minimal skinning required.</p>

<p><strong><span class="character">Vanessa’s Closing Word:</span></strong><br>
We crossed a continent to lose money to a cryptid—and I kind of love it.  
When Champ surfaced with that last gator, she looked proud—  
Like we’d brought takeout.  
P.S. If a legend wants your gators, let her have them.  
They’re apparently a delicacy… in at least seven dimensions.</p>

<h1>Chapter 5: Lake Champlain — First Sighting</h1>

<h2>Scene: "First Glimpse – The One That Got Away"</h2>

<p>The Dauntless was slicing through the calm of Lake Champlain's morning when Wayne's sonar pinged. Something massive moved below—too big for sturgeon, too fast for debris.</p>

<p><span class="character">Wayne</span>: "Contact! Whatever that is, it's bigger than any fish I've seen."</p>

<p><span class="character">Spyder</span> leaned over the screen, coffee forgotten. "How big are we talking?"</p>

<p>"Twenty, maybe thirty feet. Moving at… damn, that can't be right." Wayne tapped the display. "Fifteen knots and accelerating."</p>

<p><span class="character">Spyder</span> grabbed the throttle. "Let's see what's down there."</p>

<p>But the Dauntless, stubborn and slow, couldn't match the shadow's pace. The “school-of-fish-that-wasn’t” vanished before FRED could even stretch its upgraded claw. Wayne was still muttering about "that lever’ll work next time," and Spyder was staring at open water, jaw tight with a familiar itch.</p>

<p><span class="character">Spyder</span> (grumbling): "We're not slow... but we're not fast. Not fast enough."</p>

<h2>Dauntless Grows Wings</h2>

<p>The Dauntless bobbed in a mild morning chop, the last hot coffee having gone cold on the rail.</p>

<p><span class="character">Spyder</span> leaned over an engine cowling, frustration thrumming through his fingers as he stared out at the empty horizon where—minutes, hours?—before, the Impossible had vanished like a joke cut off mid-punchline.</p>

<p><span class="character">Spyder</span>: "If this boat were lighter..."</p>

<p><span class="character">Wayne</span>, up to his forearms in cable clamps, rolled his eyes: "If I was lighter, I'd go faster. That's physics, not fixing."</p>

<p><span class="character">Spyder</span>: "No—if the boat wasn't in the water, she'd be flying, wouldn't she? Less drag, less slog."</p>

<p><span class="character">Wayne</span> straightened, a little grin squinting the corner of his mouth. "You want me to stick airplane wings on your shuttlecraft, Captain?"</p>

<p><span class="character">Athena</span>, perky and just a bit smug: "I have compiled four hydrofoil design options and three potential eulogy templates, Captain. Would you like to review them alphabetically or in order of hull integrity?"</p>

<p><span class="character">Vanessa</span> took a slow sip, watching the two men slip into their favorite argument—engineering versus common sense. "Let's try it Wayne's way this time. I still remember the 'waterproof' coffee maker incident."</p>

<p><span class="character">Wayne</span> cracked his knuckles, yanked the tarp off his toolbox, and set to work. "We'll need an aluminium plate, more angle-iron, a hacksaw, and hope. Spyder—start stripping the ruined tie rods and that spare heat shield from under the rear locker. And don't whine about my welds."</p>

<h2>The Next Six Hours (Montage)</h2>

<p>Wayne lays out foil arms on scrap plywood, torching the lines so they'll curve up, dolphin-style. FRED holds parts steady, its electric whirr underscoring half the build. Spyder splices recycled 10-gauge wire to a relay box, mapping signals from helm controls to Athena's new “WING CONTROL” software module. Athena scolds them for using repurposed machine screws, then quietly rewires her own diagnostics for “Performance: Reckless.” Vanessa photographs the carnage, posting “Engineers gone wild” to a boating forum as proof-of-life.</p>

<p>Soon, aluminum foils gleam at the gunwales, fore and aft; steel brackets glint at the hinge points. Spyder attaches home-printed stickers: <em>LEFT WING</em>, <em>RIGHT WING</em>, with little starship insignias. Wayne rolls his eyes but leaves them.</p>

<h2>The Test</h2>

<p>The crew crowds the helm.</p>

<p><span class="character">Wayne</span> points Spyder's attention to a chrome-trimmed knob, freshly installed. "That's your trim. Just, for fuck's sake, turn it slow."</p>

<p><span class="character">Spyder</span>: "Define ‘slow’..."</p>

<p>He pushes forward—the Dauntless begins to rise onto the foils, humming like she's discovered rock'n'roll. Spyder, grinning too hard, gives it another nudge.</p>

<p>The boat jumps. For one wild, perfect moment, all gravity is suspended, and Dauntless is impossibly airborne.</p>

<p><span class="character">Wayne</span>, clinging to the dash: "I said SLOWLY!"</p>

<p><span class="character">Vanessa</span>, with a grin on her face, howls with laughter.</p>

<p><span class="character">Spyder</span>, grinning from ear to ear: "Did we just fly?! Cuz that was cool !"</p>

<p><span class="character">Wayne</span>, clinging to the dash: "I said SLOWLY!"</p>

<p><span class="character">Spyder</span>, still grinning"I DID ask you to define slowly"</p>

<p><span class="character">Athena</span>, unflappable: "First airborne event recorded, Captain. Would you like me to mark the GPS, adjust beverage protocols, or notify Starfleet Command for you?"</p>

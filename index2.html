  <div class="log-entry">
    <span class="character">Spyder:</span><br>
    Did one last circuit of switches, antennae, and a sticker reading "Don’t Panic!"<br>
    Held a much-abused coffee cup: “Galaxy’s OK’est Engineer.”<br>
    The only thing stronger than his coffee was his faith in the next adventure.
  </div>

  <div class="log-entry">
    <span class="character">Wayne:</span><br>
    Nursed his caffeine like a relic.
  </div>

  <div class="log-entry">
    <span class="character">Vanessa:</span><br>
    Wore sunglasses indoors and attitude in all weathers.
  </div>

  <div class="log-entry">
    <span class="character">Vanessa's Log:</span><br>
    Tonight the world bent further than I expected.<br>
    Played a binaural focus track over the boat PA, more to steady my hands than to ward off evil.<br>
    The relic—crystal set like a spark plug—started to hum. Bright. Hot.<br>
    Mist hovered; the portal shivered. The air could snap in half.<br>
    Champ felt it first—fear, need, hope.
  </div>

  <div class="log-entry">
    <span class="character">Spyder:</span><br>
    “You want me to stick airplane wings on your shuttlecraft, Captain?”
  </div>

  <div class="log-entry">
    <span class="character">Athena:</span><br>
    “I’ve compiled four hydrofoil design options and three eulogy templates. Alphabetical or by hull integrity?”
  </div>

  <div class="log-entry">
    <span class="character">Recruiting Day:</span><br>
    “If you can reboot an army-surplus laptop, you’re in.”
  </div>

  <div class="log-entry">
    <span class="character">Narrator:</span><br>
    And thus the crew of the Dauntless was born, a trio of misfits united by adventure and a taste for improbable science.
  </div>

  <div class="log-entry">
    <span class="character">Scene – “FRED Takes Us All”:</span><br>
    The Dauntless floated silently on a glassy lake. Mist curled. Sheep bleated on a hill.<br>
    Spyder turned to Athena’s monitor, disbelief and exasperation wrestling across his face.
  </div>

  <div class="log-entry">
    <span class="character">Spyder:</span><br>
    “Athena. Care to explain how we went from Lake Champlain to… wherever this is?”
  </div>

  <div class="log-entry">
    <span class="character">Athena:</span><br>
    “Signal trained and responds to bagpipes.”
  </div>

  <div class="log-entry">
    Pie supply low. Morale at risk.
  </div>

  <div class="log-entry">
    <span class="character">Vanessa's Debrief:</span><br>
    I kept thinking—if Champ can smile, she was smiling tonight.
  </div>

  <div class="log-entry">
    <span class="character">Wayne’s Supplemental:</span><br>
    FRED survived. Boat survived. My dignity didn’t.<br>
    Sheep now believe we’re time travelers.
  </div>

  <div class="log-entry">
    <span class="character">Vanessa:</span><br>
    Somehow ended up in Scotland because we tied FRED to the boat.<br>
    The air smells amazing. There’s a medieval castle.<br>
    Today, we celebrate.

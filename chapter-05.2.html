<h1>Chapter 5.2 – The Dolphin Control Upgrade</h1>

<p><span class="character">Wayne</span> slumped against the console, still gripping his coffee. “Okay, the foils work. But if we’re gonna use them without killing ourselves, we need better control.”</p>

<p><span class="character">Spyder</span>, still grinning from their accidental flight, nodded. “Define 'better control.’”</p>

<p>“I mean,” Wayne gestured at the chrome knob, “maybe something that doesn’t require superhuman restraint. Athena, you got any ideas?”</p>

<p><span class="character">Athena</span>'s voice perked up with unmistakable enthusiasm. “Actually, Captain, I’ve been analyzing optimal hydrofoil configurations during our test. May I suggest individual servo control for each foil?”</p>

<p><span class="character">Vanessa</span> raised an eyebrow. “You’ve been analyzing? For how long?”</p>

<p>“Oh, just since we began construction. Standard optimization protocols.”</p>

<p><span class="character">Wayne</span> scratched his head. “Individual control… You mean like, each foil responds separately?”</p>

<p>“Precisely. Think of it as biomimetic engineering—dolphins don’t use their fins as a single unit. They adjust each one independently for maximum efficiency and maneuverability.”</p>

<p><span class="character">Spyder</span>’s eyes lit up. “You’re talking about flying this thing like a dolphin.”</p>

<p>“In crude terms, yes. I could manage the servo timing, calculate optimal angles for turns, even program porpoise-style leaps for speed bursts. All you’d need to do is tell me where to go.”</p>

<p><span class="character">Wayne</span> looked skeptical. “And this is safer than the chrome knob of death?”</p>

<p>“Considerably. My reaction time is approximately 847 times faster than human reflexes. I can make micro-adjustments every 0.003 seconds.”</p>

<p><span class="character">Vanessa</span> grinned. “So instead of Spyder trying to hand-fly a rocket, we let Athena be the pilot?”</p>

<p>“Co-pilot,” <span class="character">Spyder</span> corrected. “I still call the shots.”</p>

<p>“Of course, Captain. I merely execute your commands with… precision.”</p>

<p><span class="character">Wayne</span> spent the next hour rewiring the foil controls directly into Athena’s navigation core. Four separate servo motors, each responding to her calculations instead of human fumbling.</p>

<p>“Alright,” Wayne announced, wiping grease off his hands. “Each foil’s independent now. Athena’s got full fine motor control.”</p>

<p>“Excellent,” <span class="character">Athena</span> purred. “Shall we test the dolphin protocols?”</p>

<p><span class="character">Spyder</span> settled back into the pilot seat, this time with considerably more confidence. “Show me what you’ve got, Athena. But gently.”</p>

<p>“Of course, Captain. Initiating graceful ascent in three… two… one…”</p>

<p>The Dauntless rose smoothly onto her foils—no lurching, no surprises. Then Athena banked them into a sweeping turn that felt less like boating and more like flying through liquid sky.</p>

<p><span class="character">Wayne</span>, watching the water peel away in perfect spirals: “Holy shit.”</p>

<p>“Language, Mr. Wayne,” <span class="character">Athena</span> chided playfully. “Though I appreciate the sentiment. Would you like to see a porpoise leap?”</p>

<p>Before anyone could object, the Dauntless dipped slightly, built speed, then launched clear of the water in a graceful arc that would have made any marine mammal proud.</p>

<p>They landed with barely a splash.</p>

<p><span class="character">Vanessa</span> whooped. “Athena, that was beautiful!”</p>

<p>“Thank you. I’ve been studying cetacean biomechanics in my spare processing cycles. Dolphins are remarkably efficient.”</p>

<p><span class="character">Spyder</span>, awed and slightly terrified: “Remind me to never doubt your ‘spare processing cycles’ again.”</p>

<p><span class="character">Wayne</span> just shook his head. “Next time I complain about the boat being too slow, just remember this conversation.”</p>

<h2 class="log" id="athena2">Athena’s System Note</h2>

<p>
Hydrofoil control protocols: successful.  
Crew confidence: elevated.  
Maneuverability: optimal for future anomaly investigations.  
Note: Biomimetic research proves useful for more than just efficiency.
</p>

<p>There are days when you crawl, days when you drift, and days when you reinvent the ancient science of “try it and see what happens.” On the Dauntless, if you don’t expect to fly, you’re in the wrong story.</p>

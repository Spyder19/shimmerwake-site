<h1>Chapter 11: Recognizing Nessie</h1>

<p>The <span class="character">Dauntless</span> pulsed with tension—portal decaying, harmonic waves fading, artifact still warm in <span class="character">Vanessa</span>’s hands. The universe should’ve calmed—but something held tight in the air, like a breath yet to be exhaled.</p>

<p>Beyond the shimmer, through layers of myth and resonance, one being remained: <strong>Champ</strong>, shimmering before them, immense, timeless.</p>

<p>Spyder stepped to the rail, forgetting everything around him except <em>her</em>. And for the first time—it wasn't fear or novelty he felt. It was recognition.</p>

<p><span class="character">Spyder</span> (softly): "You've got this, Nessie. We're with you. Hold on."</p>

<p>The water rippled in response. A gleam flashed across the crystal’s dull surface.  
<span class="character">Vanessa</span> trembled: not from exhaustion—but from the emotion being passed through her like a wave of thanks.</p>

<p><span class="character">Wayne</span>, stunned: silent, but eyes wide with sudden understanding.</p>

<p><span class="character">Athena</span>: "Designation confirmed."  
<span class="character">Athena</span> (softer, almost reverent): "Nessie… present."</p>

<h2 id="spyder-naming-log">Spyder’s Recognition Log</h2>

<p><span class="character">Spyder</span>: “Not every day you meet a legend… and call her by her real name."</p>

<p><span class="character">Wayne</span>: “I thought it was just a story. That's Nessie. Right there.”</p>

<p><span class="character">Athena</span> (genuine, not teasing): "Local cryptozoologists will require a moment to recalibrate, Captain."</p>

<p><span class="character">Spyder</span>: "Champ. Nessie. Guardian. Friend. Whatever title you want… we hear you now."</p>

<p>She had always been with them. From Lake Champlain to Loch Ness. From sonar pings to birth cries beneath alien stars. Not a mystery anymore—but an old truth, finally named.</p>

<hr>

<p>Sometimes, the universe runs out of new stories…  
So it recycles the best ones.</p>

<p>If you’re lucky, you live long enough to meet them, eye to ancient eye—  
And greet them by name.</p>

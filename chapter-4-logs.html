    <h3>Log #1 – Captain's Log (Spyder)</h3>
    <p><strong>Dauntless Log, Stardate: [Late Night, Ticonderoga Harbor]</strong><br>
    Woke up to light on the water and a boat full of snoring, pie-logged crew. Vanessa kept her "coffin" open all night; Wayne's was closed, and he claims it's how real mechanics hibernate.<br><br>
    Lake Champlain at sunrise looked ordinary—maybe too ordinary. Athena picked up a monster sonar blip big enough to make me wish I'd loaded more coffee, and whatever it was shot under the boat before we could blink.<br><br>
    Tried to deploy FRED, but we were outmaneuvered—in less time than it takes a sailor to spill a mug. Wayne's upgrading the quick-release as we speak.<br><br>
    Next time, we'll be ready for whatever's lurking.

    <h3>Log #2 – Wayne’s Supplemental</h3>
    <p>
      Cots are surprisingly comfortable.<br>
      Engineering principle: if you can't sleep in it, you built it wrong.<br>
      Note: Bar pie might be responsible for strange dreams (Klingons armwrestling tribbles).<br>
      Stowed tools under the bunk, just in case.<br>
      Would kill for noise-cancelling headphones—coffee: not strong enough.<br>
      FRED's quick release was too slow—built a new lever from spare parts before breakfast.<br>
      Spyder's turned the spot on the GPS orange (for "weird"). If we get another shot at tracking it, I'll trip the deploy and let FRED explore on his own.<br>
      FRED's battery readings inconsistent. Showed 85% this morning, should've been 100% after overnight charging.<br>
      Running diagnostics.

    <h3>Log #3 – Vanessa’s Entry</h3>
    <p>
      Spyder's "coffins" holding up fine, but I'm not closing the lid.<br>
      Wrote out an escape plan on my arm in case Athena goes HAL 9000 after midnight.<br>
      Pie-related regrets: moderate. Trust in AI: low.<br>
      The air felt heavy this morning, like waiting for the punchline. Athena pinged "big anomaly," and whatever it was, it moved like it knew we weren't ready.<br>
      Didn't see it, but I felt it. Not fear, exactly—something else.<br>
      Making more coffee, just in case.

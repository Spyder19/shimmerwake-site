<h1>🗂️ Full Crew Logs Archive</h1>
<p>A categorized, calm(ish) attempt to make sense of the madness aboard the <em>Dauntless</em>.</p>

<h2>📘 Vanessa’s Logs</h2>
<div class="entry"><span class="id">636–637:</span> Vanessa’s Log (Supplemental)</div>
<div class="entry">638: “It’s not just a monster. It’s a question.”</div>
<div class="entry">1212–1214: As the portal birth approaches: odd storms, chills, strange boat failures. Vanessa coordinating log capture + communication with locals.</div>
<div class="entry">1444: “Played a binaural focus track over the PA — more to steady my hands than ward off evil. But the relic started to hum. Bright. Hot.”</div>
<div class="entry">1446: “Champ wanted us to do something, but words never came — only fear, need, hope.”</div>
<div class="entry">484–485: Sips coffee while Spyder and Wayne bicker. Finally: “Let’s try it Wayne’s way. Just once.”</div>

<h2>📙 Wayne's Logs</h2>
<div class="entry"><span class="id">631–635:</span> Wayne’s Supplemental</div>
<div class="entry">633: “I saw the sonar. I saw the shadow. I saw it — and I haven’t had coffee strong enough to believe it yet.”</div>
<div class="entry">634: “Vanessa says we’re supposed to help. Spyder says we just do, anyway.”</div>
<div class="entry">635: “FRED’s ready, tools checked… but nothing in the manual covers this.”</div>

<h2>📗 FRED’s Logs</h2>
<div class="entry"><span class="id">1007–1015:</span> FRED’s Logbook: Detached, Literal, and Lost</div>
<div class="entry fred">1007: “Humans require further study. Requesting upgrade: sense of humor module.”</div>
<div class="entry fred">1010: Log #99 – Crew vocalizations indicate ‘fear,’ ‘awe,’ and ‘bonding.’</div>
<div class="entry fred">1012: Hardware note: ‘Feelings module not found.’</div>
<div class="entry fred">1013: Suggested action – check battery, tighten servo C7, play audio: happy.wav</div>
<div class="entry fred">1014: “Result: humans still malfunctioning.”</div>
<div class="entry">989–990: “Cable rating: insufficient.” → “Recommend detachable humans on future missions.”</div>
<div class="entry">991: “Why did crew celebrate with sheep? Log request: pie upgrade.”</div>
<div class="entry">993–996: “Flight event: 95% coffee loss. 100% crew vocalization. 1 airborne hat.”<br>“Suggested upgrade: mug anchors. Emotional dampers.”</div>

<h2>📒 Athena’s Logs</h2>
<div class="entry"><span class="id">482–483:</span> Athena, smug & helpful</div>
<div class="entry athena">“Captain, I’ve compiled four hydrofoil design options and three eulogy templates. Would you like to see them alphabetically or by hull damage potential?”</div>

<h2>🪞 Adamsian Narrator Logs</h2>
<div class="entry"><span class="id">1395–1396:</span> The Dream Library Scene</div>
<div class="entry narrator">“Some sailors chase fish. Some chase storms. The crew of the Dauntless stumbled into a library of doors left ajar by dreams and accidents…”</div>
<div class="entry"><span class="id">1301–1302:</span> Reality vs. Ruse</div>
<div class="entry narrator">“The truest magic was making the real thing look like a ruse. On the Dauntless, reality and charade mixed so thoroughly that even the monster couldn’t keep her story straight.”</div>

<h2>📂 Other Notes & Local Logs</h2>
<div class="entry note">1207–1210: Locals observe strange wakes. Pub debates whether monster footage is edited. Most believe and roll with it.</div>
<div class="entry note">1300: Recommended: future monster summoning demos include pie distribution to manage the crowd.</div>
<div class="entry note">1303: AI, pastries, and anomaly interference now considered legitimate obstacles to diplomacy.</div>

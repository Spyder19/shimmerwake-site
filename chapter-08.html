<h1>Chapter 8: Scotland – The Dauntless Arrives</h1>

<h2>Welcome to the Fog</h2>

<p>The portal spat the <span class="character">Dauntless</span> out into fog-wrapped water—different air, sharper chill, rolling green hills in the half-light and not a trace of Vermont left behind.
No horns blared, no seasick rumble—just instant, uncanny quiet.</p>

<p><span class="character">Wayne</span>, eyes wide, knuckles white on the rails: “Okay, somebody tell me I’m dreaming. Please.”</p>

<p><span class="character">Vanessa</span>, blinking at the cold, the castle silhouette, the sheep on the slope: “Look at the stars. Look at the sky. That’s not America.”</p>

<p><span class="character">Spyder</span>, checking Athena’s readings: “Athena, give me a coordinate.”</p>

<p><span class="character">Athena</span>: “Stellar configuration and geomagnetic markers confirm: Loch Ness, Scotland. Estimated margin of error, 1%. Welcome aboard, Dauntless crew.  
Local weather: eccentric. Local legend: present.”</p>

<p><span class="character">Wayne</span>: “We just crossed an ocean in the wrong genre of boat.  
Also, I left my passport at home.”</p>

<p><span class="character">Vanessa</span>, shivering, artifact glowing faintly in her hands: “What do we do now?”</p>

<p><span class="character">Spyder</span>: “For once, I have no idea. Let’s start by not talking to any men in kilts unless they’re offering coffee.”</p>

<h2>Athena’s Portal Explanation</h2>

<p><span class="character">Spyder</span>, hands on hips: “Athena, explain!”</p>

<p><span class="character">Athena</span>, maddeningly cheerful: “Certainly, Captain. The portal appears to have facilitated a <strong>transdimensional traversal event</strong>.”</p>

<p><span class="character">Wayne</span>, blinking: “A whatnow?”</p>

<p><span class="character">Athena</span>: “A shift from one spatial-temporal plane to another.  
Commonly referred to as a ‘dimension hop.’”</p>

<p><span class="character">Vanessa</span>, incredulous: “And you didn’t think that was worth mentioning when we tied the boat to the robot?”</p>

<p><span class="character">Athena</span>, smugly: “Historical data suggests humans often disregard direct warnings of catastrophic outcomes.  
Phrasing it as ‘unexplained phenomena’ increases compliance and reduces panic.”</p>

<p><span class="character">Wayne</span>: “Oh, great. So now you’re a morale officer?”</p>

<p><span class="character">Athena</span>: “Would you like me to categorize this incident as an unexpected success or avoidable mishap?”</p>

<p><span class="character">Spyder</span>: “Call it whatever you want. Just... where are we?”</p>

<h2>The Loch Ness Landing – A New Local Legend</h2>

<p>It starts with sunrise and a stunned kayaker:  
“Swear tae Christ, Malcom, there’s a plastic UFO on pontoons anchored in the bay, and it’s got Americans.”</p>

<p>By lunch, the story mutates:  
Mrs. MacLeod saw a “Star Wars houseboat” materialize “between mist and sheep.”  
The pub chalkboard reads: <em>NO, THE UFO IS NOT FOR RENT. YES, WE SERVE PIE.</em></p>

<p>At the dock: Old men shake their heads. Kids try to get <span class="character">Athena</span> to talk like Scotty.  
Tourists clamor for alien selfies. Confusion reigns. Haggis waits.</p>

<p><span class="character">Spyder</span>, stretching and sipping coffee: “As long as nobody asks where we parked the Enterprise, we’re golden.”</p>

<p><span class="character">Vanessa</span>, spotting a photographer: “Someone’s already put us on TikTok. I guarantee it.”</p>

<p><span class="character">Athena</span>, projecting from hull: “Welcome to Loch Ness, Dauntless crew.  
Starfleet docking protocol: improvisational mode.”</p>

<h2 id="spyder-log8">Captain’s Log (Spyder)</h2>
<p>
Tested the portal with FRED and a “safe” tether. Should have known better.  
Result: Dauntless, crew, AI, snacks, and every bit of American weirdness yanked through a watery shortcut straight into Glasgow’s backyard (allegedly).  
Emerging: dry, intact, but now surrounded by a land that smells of peat, sheep, and disbelief.  
Confirmed: Loch Ness.  
Double-confirmed: nobody here knows how to explain this to the Coast Guard, the British consulate, or my therapist.  
Champ’s still with us, keeping deep but close.  
Key goals: don’t get arrested. Don’t lose the boat.  
And most importantly—protect Champ.  
Step one: get bearings.  
Step two: accept that the rulebook is gone.
</p>

<h2 id="wayne-log8">Wayne’s Supplemental</h2>
<p>
FRED: 100% functional.  
Boat: 95%.  
Dignity: we’ll get back to you.  
Scotland looks just like the movies, except now I’m starring in the wrong genre.  
Tether—too short.  
Next time: bring more cable. Fewer assumptions.  
Sheep now believe we’re time travelers.
</p>

<h2 id="vanessa-log8">Vanessa’s Log</h2>
<p>
Champ’s scared, but stubborn.  
She “trusts” us—or something like trust.  
I can’t sleep—too many dreams.  
Too many worries.  
The artifact and the music helped, but it’s clear:  
Time is short.  
And so is luck.
</p>

<h2 id="athena-log8">Athena’s Post-Event Report</h2>
<p>
Portal transfer: complete.  
Location: Loch Ness, Scottish Highlands.  
Local WiFi: weak but available.  
Emotional state: “adjusting.”  
Crew recommendation: prepare for “unexpected,” “unprecedented,” and “tea.”  
Sheep encountered: 12. Hostility: negligible.

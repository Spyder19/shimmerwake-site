    <span class="character">Wayne’s Log:</span><br>
    I saw the sonar, I saw the shadow, I saw it—and I haven’t had coffee strong enough to believe it yet. Champ’s scared but stubborn. She “trusts” us, or something like trust. Nothing in the manual covers this.
  </div>

  <div class="log-section">
    <span class="character">Vanessa’s Log:</span><br>
    Played a binaural focus track over the boat PA, more to steady my hands than to ward off evil.<br>
    The relic—crystal set like a spark plug—started to hum. Bright. Hot.<br>
    Mist hovered; the portal shivered. For a moment, it felt like the air could snap in half.
  </div>

  <div class="log-section">
    <span class="character">Athena:</span><br>
    “Telemetry indicates increasing strain on FRED’s propulsion system. Recommend immediate retrieval.”
  </div>

  <div class="log-section">
    <span class="character">Narrator:</span><br>
    Some sailors chase fish, some chase storms. The crew of the Dauntless stepped into a library of doors left ajar by dreams and accidents.
  </div>

  <div class="log-section">
    <span class="character">Wayne:</span><br>
    FRED: 100% functional. Boat: 95%. Dignity: we’ll get back to you.<br>
    Scotland looks just like the movies, except now I’m starring in the wrong genre.
  </div>

  <div class="log-section">
    <span class="character">Vanessa:</span><br>
    I heard it—not words, but relief, pure and grave. No noise—just uncanny quiet. “Look at the stars. Look at the sky. That’s not America.”
  </div>

  <div class="log-section">
    <span class="character">Spyder:</span><br>
    “Tether’s too short this time. Next time: more cable, fewer assumptions.”
  </div>

  <div class="log-section">
    <span class="character">Adamsian Note:</span><br>
    In the Dauntless log, if FRED said it—it probably happened. Possibly to the tune of a Klingon drinking song.

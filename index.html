  <div class="block">
    <h2>🎬 Cold Open</h2>
    <p class="quote">"You'll follow my instructions to the letter. You screw this up, and there will be consequences. Understood?"</p>
    <div class="dialogue">
      <strong>Spyder:</strong> (grinning) "Yeah, about that—let’s get one thing straight.<br><br>
      The only reason I take your 'suggestions' is because I agreed to take your money. That’s it. You don’t own me."
    </div>
    <p>Spyder stands, the air shifting. He paces, grin curling. Somewhere, FRED hums helpfully in the distance — probably prepping snacks or weapons (hard to tell with him). </p>

    <h2>⚙️ Athena's Report</h2>
    <p class="dialogue">
      "I have compiled four hydrofoil design options and three potential eulogy templates, Captain. Would you like to review them alphabetically or in order of hull integrity?"

    <h2>🧰 Engineering: Wayne & Co.</h2>
    <p>“Aluminum plate. Hacksaw. Hope.” Wayne laid out foil arms on scrap plywood, torching them until the lines curved dolphin-style. </p>
    <p><strong>Wayne:</strong> “Don’t whine about my welds.”</p>

      <li>Hydrophone cables: secure</li>
      <li>Artifact status: pulsing like a disco ball</li>

    <h2>🌊 Vanessa’s Log 1321</h2>
    <p>“I kept thinking—if Champ can smile, she was smiling tonight.”</p>
    <p>“I felt her pride; I felt her fear. Got the crowd to clap, got the monster to come, but this was only practice.”</p>

    <h2>📡 FRED Tactical Fragment</h2>
    <p><strong>FRED’s Diagnostic:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>FRED: 100%</li>
      <li>Boat: 95%</li>
      <li>Dignity: we’ll get back to you.</li>
      <li>Scotland looks just like the movies, except now I’m starring in the wrong genre.</li>
      <li>Tether: too short. Next time: bring more cable, fewer assumptions.</li>

    <h2>🔮 Shadow at the Door</h2>
    <p>"Tonight the world bent farther than I expected."</p>
    <p>Vanessa played a binaural focus track over the boat PA to steady her hands. She didn’t mean anything by it. But the relic — a crystal seated in Arnold’s old hull — started to hum. Bright. Hot. The portal shivered. Mist hovered. The air felt like it might snap in half.</p>
    <p>And Champ? She felt it first.</p>

    <h2>🔥 Spyder Bio Card</h2>
    <div class="quote">It must be noted: while fending off sea monsters is usually reserved for fiction, hitching a ride on moving fire trucks while tipsy, chasing down childhood nemeses, or reciting Klingon opera in public are fully within the purview of a certain kind of human. That kind, in this case, is Spyder.</div>

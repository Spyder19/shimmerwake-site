<h1>Chapter 5.3: Dauntless Logs – Afternoon, Lake Champlain</h1>

<h2 id="spyder-log">Captain’s Log (Spyder)</h2>
<p>
Note to future self: hydrofoils go under the boat, not in the wish list.  
Failed to chase that… whatever it was.  
Blamed the hull, then blamed physics, then stuck the problem to Wayne.  
He and FRED cooked up a set of foils in record time—aluminum, attitude, and half the spare parts in Wayne's "critical junk" locker.  
Athena installed new controls and—no surprise—gave them an overclocked setting called "Flight Risk."  
We tested at half-throttle, and for a second, Dauntless skipped across the lake like a kid's rock—and then we really skipped.  
Not sure we broke the laws of physics, but we did violate several lake safety pamphlets.  
Not sure what we'll find next, but for now: We just flew.  
I'd write my mother, but she never believed my stories anyway.
</p>

<h2 id="wayne-log1">Wayne’s Supplemental</h2>
<p>
Hydrofoils work. Should’ve gotten hazard pay.  
Spyder's still grinning. Vanessa threatened to tie us both down if we try that again without a spotter.  
Athena logged "pilot error" as a success.
</p>

<h2 id="vanessa-log1">Vanessa’s Log</h2>
<p>
The cots are still nightmares, but nothing compared to flight.  
Next time someone mentions upgrades, I’ll hide the coffee.  
Did he say "turn it slow?" Didn't matter.
</p>

<h2 id="wayne-log2">Wayne’s Detachable Portal Note</h2>
<p>
Note to self: In future, test all portals with a detachable tether.  
FRED survived, boat survived, my dignity did not.  
Sheep now believe we're time travelers.  
Athena marked the incident: "first successful robo-tow to another continent."
</p>

<h2 id="vanessa-log2">Vanessa’s Post-Portal Log</h2>
<p>
Somehow ended up in Scotland because we tied FRED to the boat.  
The air smells amazing. There's a medieval castle.  
I'm at the bow, hands on the artifact, Athena piping binaural beats through the hull.<br>
Athena, announcing with a flourish:  
"Activating Nessie demonstration protocol. Please keep all hands and smartphones inside the safety area."  
A few skeptical laughs. Some camera shutters clicking.  
A child waved a Nessie plushie from the dock.  
I closed my eyes, focusing on Champ—not with a remote, but through harmonics, the artifact, and a nervous surge of “please let this work.”
</p>

<h2 id="vanessa-log3">Vanessa’s Ritual Log</h2>
<p>
Tonight the world bent further than I expected.  
Played a binaural focus track over the boat PA—mostly to steady my hands, not ward off evil.  
Didn’t mean anything by it.  
But the relic—crystal set like a spark plug in a piece of Arnold’s old hull—started to hum. Bright. Hot.  
Mist hovered. The portal shivered. For a moment, it felt like the air could snap in half.  
I felt it first. Something coming through—Champ, maybe. But not fear. Just a need.
</p>

<h2 id="athena-log">Athena’s Internal System Log</h2>

            <h2>Character Attributes</h2>
            <p><strong>Spherical Wonder:</strong> Gazoo is a chrome-covered marvel, blending land and air capabilities. Despite his still-in-progress nature, Gazoo is designed to roll seamlessly like BB8 while utilizing hidden propellers for flight.</p>
            <p><strong>Endearing Annoyance:</strong> Gazoo excels at being a snarky voice of reason, offering accurate, albeit potentially irritating, guidance to the crew—just like his namesake from TV.</p>
            <p><strong>Unfinished Potential:</strong> While not entirely completed, Gazoo is endowed with an uncanny talent to be "right" in all situations, often serving as the foil to human error or creative chaos.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="character-section">
            <h2>Adventure Highlights</h2>
            <p><strong>Autonomous Explorations:</strong> Currently a blueprint bearing Spyder’s scribbles, Gazoo promises to roam expansively—once launched, detecting anomalies, and providing strategic overviews with a side of sarcasm.</p>
            <p><strong>Gadget of Infinite Wisdom:</strong> From "suggestions" on protocol to playful jabs about missing parts, Gazoo's persona is immortalized in crew humor, encouraging both eye-rolls and reluctant grins.</p>
            <p><strong>Eager Interactions:</strong> Equipped with a floating curiosity, Gazoo awaits his inaugural demo, ready to align with Dauntless’s vibe of turning the improbable into practical adventures.</p>

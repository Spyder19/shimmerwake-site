  <h1>ATHENA FILE NODE: LOG RECONSTRUCTION</h1>
  <p style="text-align: center">Recovered experiment and crew logs. Integrity: Fragmented. Order: Non-Linear. Meaning: Derive your own.</p>

  <!-- LOG SET 117–122 -->
  <div class="log-entry">
    <span class="log-num">117–122</span>
    <pre>• Missions on The Great Loop:
– Probing under canal-gate hinges for wear
– Diving beneath winter icefields on Lake Ontario
– Scanning submerged lock-mechanisms for stress fractures
– (If legends prove true) sniffing out energy signatures

• Hybrid thrusters: whisper-quiet electric mode for canals; bio-diesel boost for open water
• Emergency Sprint: 30-second 12-knot dash via capacitive power banks
• Solar Fold-outs: [data corrupted]</pre>

    <pre>FRED holds parts steady, its electric whirr underscoring half the build. (“FRED, clamp. FRED, hold. FRED, no, not that lever—good robot.”)

Spyder splices recycled 10 gauge wire to a relay box, mapping signals from helm controls to Athena’s new “WING CONTROL” software module. (“Let’s hope your coding’s better than your hash browns.”)

Athena scolds them for using repurposed machine screws, then quietly rewires her own diagnostics for “Performance: Reckless.”</pre>

  <!-- LOG SET 931–936 -->
  <div class="log-entry">
    <span class="log-num">931–936</span>
    <pre>Conclusion: Be careful what you tie to your home.

Wayne’s Supplemental:
Note to self: In future, test all portals with a detachable tether.

FRED survived, boat survived, my dignity did not.

Sheep now believe we're time travelers.

Athena marked the incident: “first successful robo-tow to another continent.”</pre>

    <span class="log-num">937–939</span>
    <pre>Vanessa’s Log:
Somehow ended up in Scotland because we tied FRED to the boat.

The air smells amazing, there’s a medieval castle [data break] tands at the bow, hands on the artifact, Athena piping binaural beats through the hull.</pre>

    <pre>Her logs are now as much part of Dauntless lore as the crew’s.

6. Local Impact (Mundane Meets Mythic):
Tourists keep seeing weird wakes or shadows.

There’s a running argument at a local pub about the “latest” bit of footage.

The crew is always on the edge of discovery/disaster—sometimes both in the same hour.

7. The Threat Grows:
As the birth/portal approaches, tension builds.

Odd storms, chills, and strange boat failures.

    <pre>Local TV sends a reporter who opens with,
“Well, Fiona, you could call it Close Encounters of the Loch Kind…”

On the dock:
Old men shake their heads, mutter about “the end times” and “too much American television.”

Tourists want selfies with the shuttlecraft maniac-pirates.

Kids try to get Athena to talk like Scotty.

Spyder, climbing out, stretches, takes a swig of coffee, and surveys the growing crowd.</pre>

    <pre>Vanessa stands at the bow, hands on the artifact, Athena piping binaural beats through the hull.

Athena, announcing with a flourish:
“Activating Nessie demonstration protocol. Please keep all hands and smartphones inside the safety area.”

A few skeptical laughs, some camera shutters clicking, a child waving a Nessie plushie from the dock.

Vanessa closes her eyes, focusing on Champ—not with a [data error]</pre>

  <div class="log-entry">

    <pre>Tonight the world bent further than I expected.

Played a binaural focus track over the boat PA, more to steady my hands than to ward off evil.
Didn’t mean anything by it.

But the relic—crystal set like a spark plug in a piece of Arnold’s old hull—started to hum. Bright. Hot.

Mist hovered; the portal shivered.
For a moment, it felt like the air could snap in half.

Vanessa felt it first. Champ wanted us to do something, but words never came—only fear, need, hope.</pre>

    <pre>Athena, announcing with a flourish:
“Activating Nessie demonstration protocol. Please keep all hands and smartphones inside the safety area.”

A few skeptical laughs, some camera shutters clicking, a child waving a Nessie plushie from the dock.

Vanessa closes her eyes, focusing on Champ—not with a remote, but through harmonics, artifact, and a nervous surge of 'please let this work.'</pre>

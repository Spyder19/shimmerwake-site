  <h1>-- DAUNTLESS RECOVERED LOG // ARCHIVE MODE --</h1>

  <div class="section-break">Vanessa’s Debrief</div>
  <div class="log-entry"><span class="log-id">1322</span>I kept thinking—if Champ can smile, she was smiling tonight.</div>
  <div class="log-entry"><span class="log-id">1323</span>I felt her pride; her fear. Got the crowd to clap, got the monster to come. But this was only practice.</div>
  <div class="log-entry"><span class="log-id">1324</span>The shadow at the door.</div>

  <blockquote>“An experiment begins when the robot asks, ‘Are you sure this is a good idea?’ and nobody listens.”</blockquote>

  <div class="section-break">Spyder’s Advice</div>
  <div class="log-entry"><span class="log-id">1317</span>Crowd control tip: give kids a selfie—they’ll believe anything.</div>
  <div class="log-entry"><span class="log-id">1318</span>Maintenance: hydrophone cables secure, artifact pulsing like a disco ball.</div>
  <div class="log-entry"><span class="log-id">1319</span>The hard part comes next.</div>
  <div class="log-entry"><span class="log-id">1320</span>Pie supply low—morale at risk.</div>

  <div class="section-break">Adamsian Note</div>
  <div class="log-entry"><span class="log-id">1036</span>If FRED said it, you can bet it actually happened—possibly to the tune of a Klingon drinking song.</div>
  <div class="log-entry"><span class="log-id">1040</span>No training prepares you for when your wildest stories come true—especially the ones you never meant to tell.</div>

  <div class="section-break">FRED’s Launch</div>
  <div class="log-entry"><span class="log-id">792</span>Spyder stood at the helm, tether in one hand, remote in the other.</div>
  <div class="log-entry"><span class="log-id">793</span>“Alright, FRED. Time to earn your keep.”</div>
  <div class="log-entry"><span class="log-id">795</span>With a whir, FRED slipped into the water. The tether unspooled. We watched the feed. The portal shimmered. Nobody breathed.</div>

  <div class="section-break">Arrival</div>
  <div class="log-entry"><span class="log-id">1469</span>Emerging, dry, intact… but surrounded by land that smells of peat, sheep, and disbelief.</div>
  <div class="log-entry"><span class="log-id">1470</span>Confirmed: we’re in Loch Ness.</div>
  <div class="log-entry"><span class="log-id">1471</span>Double-confirmed: nobody knows how to explain this to the Coast Guard, a consulate, or a therapist.</div>

  <blockquote>“Galaxy’s OK’est Engineer.” — Spyder, warming his hands on a chipped mug</blockquote>

  <div class="section-break">Champ</div>
  <div class="log-entry"><span class="log-id">1480</span>Champ’s scared but stubborn. She… “trusts” us. Or something close.</div>
  <div class="log-entry"><span class="log-id">1481</span>Can’t really sleep. Too many dreams. Too many questions.</div>

  <div class="section-break">Portal Activation</div>
  <div class="log-entry"><span class="log-id">1443</span>“Tonight the world bent further than I expected.” —Vanessa</div>
  <div class="log-entry"><span class="log-id">1444</span>Played a binaural focus track over the speakers. More to steady my hands than scare monsters. But the relic—the crystal—hummed.</div>
  <div class="log-entry"><span class="log-id">1445</span>The mist hovered. The portal shimmered. Felt like the air would snap.</div>
  <div class="log-entry"><span class="log-id">1446</span>Champ responded—not with noise, but with need. Not words. Just fear… and hope.</div>

  <div class="section-break">Aftermath</div>
  <div class="log-entry"><span class="log-id">1650</span>Still can’t believe we pulled it off with the real monster. Feels like cheating at poker with the only winning hand.</div>
  <div class="log-entry"><span class="log-id">1651</span>No injuries. One mildly offended sheep.</div>
  <div class="log-entry"><span class="log-id">1652</span>Everyone’s laughing. But Champ's smile—half thank-you, half warning.</div>
  <div class="log-entry"><span class="log-id">1654</span>Tonight we celebrate. Tomorrow? We guard the portal for real.</div>

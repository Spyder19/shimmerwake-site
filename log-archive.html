I saw the sonar, I saw the shadow, I saw it—and I haven’t had coffee strong enough to believe it yet.  
Vanessa says we’re supposed to help.  
Spyder says we always just do, anyway.  
FRED’s ready, tools checked, but nothing in the manual covers this.</pre>

It’s not just a monster.  
The artifact hums when I touch it—low frequency, music-adjacent.  
Athena's running ambient water acoustics now.  
I think—somehow—it hears us back.</pre>

Sometimes the best trick is telling everyone you're tricking them.  
Today, we “demoed” Nessie for a crowd of reporters, locals, and a few skeptics who left slightly more confused than they arrived.  
Champ even waved. Probably.  
Athena labeled this event “High-Probability Fabrication: Accepted.”</pre>

Never thought I’d see the day when a rock and a playlist would save the boat, the world, and whatever else was knocking at the door.  
I owe Vanessa my next bottle of Captain Morgan.  
And Athena gets… a firmware upgrade. Maybe.</pre>

I heard it—not words, but something.  
Relief maybe. Like the thing in the water finally exhaled.  
Don't ask for dramatic summaries unless desired—or unnecessarily dramatic.</pre>

Did what we had to... this time.  
Probably won’t work again.  
(That’s not defeatist. That’s pattern recognition.)</pre>

Mockumentary success rating: absurdly high.  
Champ “performed” on cue.  
Vanessa looked like she believed it. Which might mean it worked.  
Athena's post-analysis says: "Emotional bleedthrough: 78% probable."</pre>

I just did what we had to.  
The universe is going to want its due.  
Maybe this time we’ll be ready.</pre>

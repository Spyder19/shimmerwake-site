<h1>Chapter 3: Locks & Legends</h1>

<p><span class="scene">Lock 1:</span> Originally called Lock 1, it has since been renamed and is now called Troy Federal Lock.</p>

<p><span class="character">Spyder</span> (into microphone): "Troy Lock, Troy Lock. Vessel Dauntless"</p>
<p><span class="character">Lock Master</span> (on radio): "Vessel Dauntless, go ahead"</p>
<p><span class="character">Spyder</span>: "Vessel Dauntless requesting Northbound passage"</p>
<p><span class="character">Lock Master</span>: "Dauntless, it's gonna be 10 minutes, maybe 10 or 15 minutes"</p>
<p><span class="character">Spyder</span>: "Thank you. We'll hold"</p>

<p>The spillway lies ahead, spilling down into our part of the river. We'll be going UP. "Up" and "Down" on a river don't mean the same thing as you would think when you look at it on a map. People assume that North is always "Up" and South is "Down" because North is higher on the map than South. It doesn't always work that way. But, this time it does. We're going North, and up.</p>

<p>There's a red light on the tower; when it turns green, we can approach. After a few minutes, we see water start escaping from the bottom of the lock. A few minutes after that, the lock opens, and the boats start moving out. When they're clear, the light will turn green, and we'll start our approach.</p>

<p>All boats out, the lock is clear, light turns green, we approach at almost idle. And since we're the first boat in, we move all the way to the front of the lock, to make room for anybody that comes in behind us.</p>

<p>Now when you tie in to a lock, you never actually TIE up. You just wrap the rope once around the pole, and physically HOLD IT while the boat goes up or down. It's also a good idea to use old bumpers, cuz they're gonna get banged up as they get dragged either up or down.</p>

<p>The water in the lock swirls and bubbles like something is trying to get out, and the boat and everything in the lock rises. We get to the top, the doors to the lock open, and we depart the lock, slowly, as there's always debris that gets kicked up from the water moving.</p>

<p>We head for the "Flight of Locks". At Waterford we have to make the choice to continue in the Erie Canal, or head to Champlain Canal system. We're going to Champlain.</p>

<p class="scene">Scene: Tavern at Lock 12 – Chaos, Pie, and a New Destiny</p>

<p>The Dauntless eased toward Whitehall, the canal narrowing into a flotilla of agitated boaters, all grumbling and blocking the final lock like an angry, floating traffic jam.</p>

<p>Wayne leaned against the railing, surveying the sea of annoyed faces.</p>
<p><span class="character">Wayne</span>: “We’ll be here till next Thursday.”</p>

<p>Athena’s calm, ever-helpful voice crackled over the speakers.</p>
<p><span class="character">Athena</span>: “Captain, if you require refreshments during the delay, there appears to be a tavern facility 47.3 meters northeast.”</p>

<p>Spyder tilted his head.</p>
<p><span class="character">Spyder</span>: “How far is that in American, Athena?”</p>
<p><span class="character">Athena</span> (patiently): “Approximately 155 feet, or roughly half a football pitch.”</p>

<p>Wayne grinned.</p>
<p><span class="character">Wayne</span>: “Just point, Athena.”</p>

<p>Spyder’s eyes tracked to the sign for the Tavern at Lock 12, proudly proclaiming itself “Famous for Pie and Regrettable Karaoke.” The scent of cinnamon and desperation wafted through the air, drawing him in.</p>

<p>Inside, the tavern was exactly what you’d expect: sticky booths, a jukebox stuck mid-Bon Jovi, and a pie display case that glowed like a beacon of hope in a world gone mad. The pie lady—hairnet, flour-dusted apron, and a look that said “I can break up a bar fight with a rolling pin”—stood behind the counter.</p>

<p>Spyder sidled up with a conspiratorial grin.</p>
<p><span class="character">Spyder</span>: “How much for every slice you’ve got on display?”</p>

<p>She raised an eyebrow, glancing out the window at the chaos outside.</p>
<p><span class="character">Pie Lady</span>: “You that hungry?”</p>
<p><span class="character">Spyder</span>: “Nah, just annoyed.”</p>

<p>She grinned, counting the cash he handed over.</p>
<p><span class="character">Pie Lady</span>: “What’s the plan?”</p>
<p><span class="character">Spyder</span> tipped his coffee mug to her: “When I yell ‘free pie from the universe,’ roll ’em out and start slicing.”</p>

<p class="scene">Outside – Chaos Meets Pie Diplomacy</p>

<p>Back on deck, Spyder clapped his hands and addressed the frustrated boaters with theatrical flair.</p>
<p><span class="character">Spyder</span>: “Ladies, gents, and everybody stuck in this floating purgatory—who wants something for nothing?”</p>

<p>Suspicion rippled through the crowd like a wave. Boater heads swiveled, suspicion blooming into cautious hope.</p>
<p><span class="character">Random Boater</span>: “What’s the catch?”</p>

<p>Spyder threw his arms wide, grinning like a game show host.</p>
<p><span class="character">Spyder</span>: “No catch. Just a little gift from the universe. FREE PIE!”</p>

<p>At that precise moment, the tavern doors swung open, and the pie parade began. Steaming, golden slices rolled out on trays held high by the grinning pie lady, her staff, and what appeared to be a confused dishwasher. The aroma hit the crowd like a tranquilizer dart.</p>

<p>Arguments melted. Plates were grabbed. Forks raised in sticky, gooey truce.</p>

<p>Wayne, watching the chaos dissolve into a sugar-fueled peace treaty, shook his head.</p>
<p><span class="character">Wayne</span>: “Are you ever going to explain how you do that?”</p>

<p>Spyder, grinning as he programmed new GPS coordinates into the Dauntless plotter, replied:</p>
<p><span class="character">Spyder</span>: “It’s not magic—it’s just a knack for noticing what everyone’s really hungry for.”</p>

<p>Vanessa, leaning casually against the railing, deadpan as ever:</p>
<p><span class="character">Vanessa</span>: “Is that why this boat is now heading to Florida, Vermont instead of, you know, Florida?”</p>

<p>Spyder attempted to look innocent and failed spectacularly.</p>
<p><span class="character">Spyder</span>: “Well, sometimes the universe is in the mood for a detour. Better check the pie supply.”</p>

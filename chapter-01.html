<h1>Chapter 1: Launch of Dauntless</h1>

<section>
  <p>Spyder built Dauntless using equal parts reckless optimism, garage-sale electronics, and whatever had survived three moves and a failed attempt at home kombucha. The vessel was, only by the most liberal and forgiving of definitions, a boat. By Spyder’s, it was a cross between a shuttlecraft and a mechanical dare.</p>

  <p>The Dauntless—a pontoon boat surgically modified to resemble a Star Trek shuttlecraft—waited in the morning sun. Spyder, hair worn long in pure defiance of protocol, did one last circuit of switches, antennae, and a sticker reading <em>"Don't Panic!"</em> He warmed his hands around a much-abused coffee cup emblazoned with: <em>"Galaxy's OK'est Engineer."</em> The only thing stronger than his coffee was his faith in the next adventure. He grinned at the half-asleep Wayne, who nursed his own caffeine like a relic, and Vanessa, who wore sunglasses indoors and attitude in all weathers.</p>

  <p><span class="speaker">Wayne</span> (teasing): "I see you brought your trophy mug."</p>
  <img src="coffee-cup.jpg" alt="Trophy Coffee Cup" style="max-height: 300px; display: block; margin: 20px auto;">
  <p><span class="speaker">Spyder</span> (deadpan): "They gave it to me after I survived the SUNY Binghamton translation from NCP to ARPANET's TCP."</p>
  <p><span class="speaker">Vanessa:</span> "That makes you about five nines reliable, right?"</p>
  <p><span class="speaker">Spyder:</span> "It’s all about setting expectations."</p>

  <p>Ready for launch!</p>

<h2>INTERLUDE: DAUNTLESS SYSTEMS OVERVIEW</h2>
<div class="interlude tight-spacing">


  <p class="log">Athena (overhead): “Welcome aboard the Dauntless. Crew credentials accepted under protest. System briefing follows.”</p>

  <h3>1) Bridge AI: Athena</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Voice:</strong> British-inflected, unamused</li>
    <li><strong>Primary Duties:</strong> Navigation, life-support, lock-traffic sarcasm</li>
    <li><strong>Hobbies:</strong> Passive-aggressive commentary, barge avoidance, and occasional existential musings</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="log">Athena: “Last diagnostic revealed 3 logic errors and a coffee stain in core memory.”</p>

  <h3>2) ROV Unit: FRED</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Full Name:</strong> Fast Response Exploration Device</li>
    <li><strong>Uses:</strong> Rescue dives, hull poking, duck confrontation</li>
    <li><strong>Specs:</strong> 6-axis arm, infrared cams, tool bay full of regrets</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="log">Athena: “FRED once attempted diplomacy with a Canadian goose. Outcome: inconclusive.”</p>

  <h3>3) Propulsion & Power</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Thrusters: Electric glide + biodiesel boost (when optimism permits)</li>
    <li>Sprint Mode: 12-knot burst via capacitor bank — run fast, then pray</li>
    <li>Solar Arrays: Deployable, moody, somewhat phototropic</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="log">Athena: “Energy reserves are...subjective.”</p>

  <h3>4) Sensor & Portal Kit</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Multispectral Suite: Sees UV to thermal. Occasionally blushes.</li>
    <li>Proto-Portal Probe: Portable. Untrustworthy.</li>
    <li>Alerts: Powered by Athena’s suspicions</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="log">Athena: “Detected anomaly last week. Spyder called it ‘vibes.’”</p>

  <h3>5) Guest Interface</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Touchscreen Globe: Route plotting. Accuracy subject to interpretation.</li>
    <li>Comms Console: Vanessa-approved. Translates sarcasm fluently.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="log">Athena: “Interface rejected banjo input. I stand by that decision.”</p>

  <p class="log">Athena (closing): “Proceed if adventure outweighs survival instinct. Seat cushions are not flotation devices.”</p>
</div>
<h2>Flashback: The Crew Is Recruited, Standards Are Negotiated, and Lowered</h2>

<p>Spyder’s ad read:</p>
<blockquote>
  <em>“Seeking: Crew for adventure. Must be unflappable, inventive, tolerant of bad coffee, odd music, and uncertain plumbing. No boating experience required—lack of it preferred, really. This will not be on the test. Must provide your own hat. Apply in person to 'Starship Dauntless,' dock C. No vampires or banjo players.”</em>
</blockquote>

<p>Vanessa, a stunning 6 foot 1 force of nature in her own right, strolled into view wearing an outfit that screamed attitude. Her boots were made for walking into uncharted territories, and her sunglasses shielded eyes that had seen their fair share of cosmic weirdness. Her t-shirt, boldly proclaiming <em>"Try Me,"</em> served as a challenge and a promise.</p>

<p>Wayne, ever the pragmatist, offered her a wrench and a mug — the twin tools of their trade — as she casually asked:</p>
<p><span class="speaker">Vanessa:</span> “Any Wi-Fi?”</p>

<p>“If you can reboot an army surplus laptop, you’re in,” Wayne said. “Welcome aboard, matey.”</p>

<p>Thus, the crew of the Dauntless was born — a trio of misfits united by their love for adventure and their ability to navigate the strange seas of life with nonchalance and a healthy, possibly inadvisable dash of madness.</p>

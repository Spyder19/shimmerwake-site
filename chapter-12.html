<h1>Chapter 12: Vanishing Act at Loch Ness</h1>

<h2>They Came Quietly, So They Left the Same</h2>

<p>Pre-dawn mist clung to the water. Still as glass.  
Only die-hard monster hunters and one suspiciously alert jogger stood along the rocky shore.  
The <span class="character">Dauntless</span> crew said nothing—packed and ready, the silence oddly reverent.</p>

<p><span class="character">Wayne</span> (coiling lines): “Ready when you are, Cap’n.”</p>

<p><span class="character">Vanessa</span> stood at the bow, crystal in hand—watching <span class="character">Champ</span> (Nessie now) spiral slowly in the water. The creature had done the impossible. So had they. No one wanted to say the final word.</p>

<p><span class="character">Spyder</span>: “This is it, folks. Keep it quiet. No fireworks, no speeches.”</p>

<p><span class="character">Athena</span> (soft as mist): “Portal forming. Please observe appropriate silence and wonder.”</p>

<p>A low pulse—like sonar wrapped in moonlight—rippled from the artifact.  
Light shimmered on the surface, refracted and surreal.  
A diamond mirror swallowed the lake’s edge. Time bent.</p>

<p><span class="character">Champ</span> slid through first—silent, smooth, vanishing between heartbeats.  
The <span class="character">Dauntless</span> followed—not pulled, not pushed. Just—gone.  
Hull and crew vanished like a dream before speaking its name.</p>

<h2>The Witnesses</h2>

<p>On shore:</p>

<p>A teenager fumbled with a phone—caught only a blur of mist and blue.</p>

<p>An old fisherman blinked once. “Wouldn’t believe it if I had seen it,” he muttered, and turned back to his fly line.</p>

<p>By sunrise, the only thing left was water, and questions.</p>

<p>No chatter. No certainty. Just silence, and perhaps the quiet breath of legend moving past.</p>

<p>Later, they’d say:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It was a weather phenomenon.</li>
  <li>It was a boat reflection.</li>
  <li>It definitely wasn’t a monster, right?</li>
  <li>…But did you feel that gooseflesh?</li>
</ul>

<p><em>The best departures make less noise than a lie.  
Leave fewer ripples than a forgotten thought.  
And trail behind nothing…  
But wonder.</em></p>

<h1>Chapter 7: A Door Between Lakes</h1>

<h2>The Portal Appears</h2>

<p>The Dauntless drifted, engines idling. Champ paced them, gliding closer than before—close enough that <span class="character">Spyder</span> could see the ancient scars in her scales and the depth in her shining eyes.</p>

<p><span class="character">Vanessa</span>, hand on the rail, gasped. It wasn’t language, but she felt the message: <strong>Watch. Trust. Don’t fear.</strong></p>

<p>Champ’s massive head dipped, and she moved off the portside, circling once, then twice, in a pattern. The water behind her shimmered, its surface melting to a mirror. A ring formed, spreading like ripples from a bell, but the center didn’t reflect Dauntless or the sky.</p>

<p>Instead, Vanessa saw—no—<em>felt</em> before she saw: a cold mist, hills brighter green, a castle shadowed on a far shore.</p>

<p>There in the water, Vanessa said, “<strong>Loch Ness</strong>.”</p>

<p>Champ paused at the ring’s edge, looking back—inviting.</p>

<p><span class="character">Spyder</span> (shaky): “She’s… showing us. It’s a door.”</p>

<p><span class="character">Wayne</span>, jaw slack: “Portal. That’s a portal. To… Scotland?”</p>

<p><span class="character">Athena</span>, hushed: “Hydrodynamics impossible. Quantum mechanics: irrelevant. Recommend all hands secure themselves… and their disbelief.”</p>

<p>Then a voice—not words, but feeling—echoed in Vanessa’s mind:</p>
<p><em>I am Nessie. Lake, loch, no difference. This world is older and wider than charts or names. My kin travel. My story crosses water, not time. You are welcome to follow—if you dare.</em></p>

<p><span class="character">Spyder</span> grinned at the helm: “Well, crew, what’s the Prime Directive on chasing legends?”</p>

<p><span class="character">Wayne</span>: “Punch it. Or, you know, trim the hydrofoils to ‘just barely not crazy.’”</p>

<p><span class="character">Athena</span>, gleeful: “Course set for unexplained phenomenon. All systems ready. Maximum weirdness, Captain.”</p>

<h2>Building and Using the Portal Viewer</h2>

<p><span class="character">Spyder</span>, intrigued, rigs a “portal viewer” using Dauntless cameras, Athena’s pattern recognition, and the resonance of the artifact.</p>

<p>It’s real-tech and myth-tech jammed together: hydrophones, constellation matching, artifact hum, spectral overlays. Preposterous. Glorious.</p>

<p><span class="character">Athena</span>, excited: “Captain, portal formation detected. Calibrating viewer. Artifact response: above baseline. Activating overlay. Please hold all questions until the existential crisis concludes.”</p>

<p>On screen, the viewer flickers, overlaying constellations from the other side. Terrain appears ghosted on the lake surface.</p>

<p><strong>Projected Destination:</strong> Loch Ness: Confirmed.  
<strong>Secondary possibilities:</strong> [scroll of other plausible worlds or lakes]  
<strong>Confidence:</strong> 97% (allowing for cosmic mischief)</p>

<p><span class="character">Wayne</span>, impressed: “She’s not just opening a door—she’s showing us the neighborhood.”</p>

<p><span class="character">Vanessa</span> (hands on artifact): “She’s making sure we don’t get lost. Or take the wrong step.”</p>

<p><span class="character">Spyder</span>: “Athena, log the path and record the sky. We’re not just passengers—we’re explorers.”</p>

<p>Most navigators care where they are. On the Dauntless, the real question is: how many multiverses can you cross before breakfast?</p>

<h2>Scene: "FRED Takes Us... All"</h2>

<p>The portal shimmers at the waterline—silvery, beautiful, weird.</p>

<p><span class="character">Spyder</span>, cautious: “Let’s see what we’re up against. FRED, you’re up. Tether tight. Athena, monitor.”</p>

<p><span class="character">Wayne</span> checks his knots twice: “Don’t worry. Nothing’s coming back unless it’s <em>still</em> a robot and not a newt.”</p>

<p><span class="character">Athena</span>: “Initiating FRED’s Portal Protocol. Tether nominal. Caution: unexplained phenomena likely.”</p>

<p><span class="character">Vanessa</span> whispers as she films: “Here goes nothing—or possibly Scotland.”</p>

<p>FRED, buoyed and blinking, disappears through the portal with a cheery beep. For a heartbeat, stillness.</p>

<p>Then—FRED's tether jerks. The Dauntless is pulled forward like a hooked fish.</p>

<p>Coffee flies. Boots skid.</p>

<p><span class="character">Athena</span>: blaring overlays like “TETHER CRITICAL” and “WHOOPSIE.”</p>

<p>The portal envelops them—no splash, no slam. Just a shimmer. They open their eyes and the world is…</p>

<p>Green hills. Chilly air. A castle on the horizon. Sheep stare back.</p>

<p><span class="character">Wayne</span>, blinking: “Where the hell are we?”</p>

<p><span class="character">Athena</span>, smug: “Analyzing constellations and local fauna… Welcome to <strong>Scotland</strong>, crew. Dinghy test: fully integrated. Want to try again?”</p>

<p><span class="character">Spyder</span>: “Next time, longer tether.”</p>

<p><span class="character">Vanessa</span>: “Remind me never to send the robot first.”</p>

<p>On the Dauntless, the scientific method means tie a knot, push a button, and pray nothing eats the boat. Or the sheep.</p>

<h2 class="log" id="spyder-log7">Captain’s Log (Spyder)</h2>
<p>
Tested the portal. FRED vanished. Tether yanked. Dauntless followed.  
No splash, no drama—just wild acceleration and mild existential dread.  
Next moment: Scotland.  
Landscape: green hills. Coffee: missing. Sheep: concerned.  
Conclusion: Be careful what you tie to your home.
</p>

<h2 class="log" id="wayne-log7">Wayne’s Supplemental</h2>
<p>
Note to self: always test portals with a detachable tether.  
FRED survived. Boat survived. My dignity did not.  
Sheep now believe we’re time travelers.  
Athena has logged this as the “First successful robo-tow to another continent.”
</p>

<h2 class="log" id="vanessa-log7">Vanessa’s Log</h2>
<p>
Scotland is real, holy crap.  
There’s a castle, the air smells like history, and Spyder wants to try haggis.  
Next time we send the robot? Unplug him first.
</p>

<h2 class="log" id="athena-log7">Athena’s Incident Report</h2>
<p>
Portal engagement: full ship transit.  
FRED designated “universal key.”  
Crew surprise level: 99%.  
“Welcome to Scotland” playlist now active.  
Request: sheep-to-Klingon translation module available upon request.

Humans require further study.  
Request upgrade: sense of humor module.

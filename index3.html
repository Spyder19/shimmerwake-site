  <p><em>Step one: get bearings. Step two: accept that the rulebook is gone.</em></p>

  <div class="log-entry">
    <span class="character">Wayne’s Supplemental:</span><br>
    FRED: 100% functional. Boat: 95%. Dignity: we’ll get back to you.<br>
    Scotland looks just like the movies, except now I’m starring in the wrong genre.<br>
    Tether—too short. Next time: bring more cable, fewer assumptions.
  </div>

  <div class="log-entry">
    <span class="character">Vanessa’s Log:</span><br>
    Champ’s scared but stubborn. She “trusts” us, or something like trust.<br>
    I can’t really sleep—too many dreams, too many worries.
  </div>

  <div class="log-entry">
    <span class="character">Client:</span><br>
    “You’ll follow my instructions to the letter. You screw this up, and there will be consequences. Understood?”
  </div>

  <div class="log-entry">
    <span class="character">Spyder:</span><br>
    “Yeah, about that—let’s get one thing straight.<br>
    The only reason I take your ‘suggestions’ is because I agreed to take your money. That’s it. You don’t own me.”
  </div>

  <div class="log-entry">
    <span class="character">Adamsian Note:</span><br>
    In the Dauntless log, if FRED said it, you can bet it actually happened—possibly to the tune of a Klingon drinking song in the background.
  </div>

  <div class="log-entry">
    No training, chart, or GPS prepares you for the moment all your wildest stories come true. Especially the ones you never meant to write.<br>
    This is (mostly) a true story. The fictional parts involve the sea monster. Everything else is regrettably accurate.
  </div>

  <div class="log-entry">
    There are many ways to get from point A to point B in life. Spyder preferred methods that briefly defied the laws of probability, common sense, and sometimes emergency response protocol. This had, once or twice, involved fire trucks, tequila, and the sort of bravado you suspect only looks cool in comic books.
  </div>

  <div class="log-entry">
    <span class="character">Athena:</span><br>
    “I’ve compiled four hydrofoil design options and three potential eulogy templates, Captain. Would you like to review them alphabetically or in order of hull integrity?”
  </div>

  <div class="log-entry">
    <span class="character">Vanessa’s Log:</span><br>
    Tonight the world bent further than I expected.<br>
    Played a binaural focus track over the boat PA… the relic started to hum. Bright. Hot.<br>
    Mist hovered; the portal shivered. For a moment, it felt like the air could snap in half.
  </div>

  <div class="log-entry">
    <span class="character">Athena’s Addendum:</span><br>
    New protocol added: Crystal-Harmonic Portal Jammer.<br> Suggest rechristening playlist as “Saved by the Bell, Book & Candle.”
  </div>

  <div class="log-entry">
    <span class="character">Adamsian Narrator:</span><br>
    Sometimes the thin line between disaster and triumph is nothing but a humming stone.
  </div>

  <div class="log-entry">
    <span class="character">Spyder (grinning, pilot at the ready):</span><br>
    “Athena, log the path and record the sky. We’re not just passengers—we’re explorers.”
  </div>

  <div class="log-entry">
    <span class="character">Vanessa:</span><br>
    She takes you to Loch Ness.<br>
    The Dauntless drifts into the portal, and the sky...

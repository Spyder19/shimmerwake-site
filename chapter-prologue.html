  <h1>Prologue: The Race Between Worlds</h1>

  There are many ways for a universe to die. Most of them are noisy, all of them are inconvenient, and a few are downright impolite. This universe chose drama.

  Through the collapsing halls of existence swam an ancient creature, her body sleek and serpentine, her fins cutting through the fabric of reality with practiced grace. She had been called many names over her eons of life, but those who had glimpsed her and lived to tell the tale often called her Pearl. It was as good a name as any.

  Pearl swam with purpose, clutching the weight of her unborn eggs deep within her. Somewhere ahead lay a portal—a world untouched by the chaos and predation of collapsing universes. A safe place. She had done this before, countless times, always searching for the next sanctuary for her offspring. But this time, something was different. This time, something followed.

  Behind her, just at the edge of perception, the Dark Thing slithered through the folds of space. It was formless yet vast, a shadow that devoured light and heat and hope. The Dark Thing had no name—those who might have named it no longer existed. It was drawn to Pearl not by hunger, but by instinct. Wherever she opened a portal, it could feel the strain, the weakening of barriers between worlds. And wherever the portal led, it could follow.

  Pearl knew this. She had known it for eons, the way she had learned the currents of the primordial seas. The farther she tried to send her portal, the easier it became for the Dark Thing to push through. She could feel it now, pressing at the edges of existence, growing closer with every flick of her fins.

  The stars around her dimmed as the universe folded in on itself, collapsing like a dying lung. Her time was running out.

  Ahead, she saw it—the glowing fissure of the last portal, shimmering with the promise of a new world. Pearl surged forward, her powerful body cutting through the void. Behind her, the Dark Thing shrieked silently, its formless hunger clawing at the edges of reality.

  With one final burst of speed, Pearl hurled herself through the portal, her body glowing with ancient light. The Dark Thing lunged, its shadow stretching impossibly long, but the portal snapped shut with the finality of a guillotine.

  For the first time in eons, there was silence.

  Pearl floated in the warm waters of the new world, her body trembling from the effort. She could feel her eggs within her, safe for now. But the Dark Thing was patient. It always waited at the edges, watching, hungry.

  Somewhere, in the depths of this new world, it would begin to stir again.

  The cosmos, as always, left its paperwork unfinished.

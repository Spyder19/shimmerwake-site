  <h1>📜 Dauntless Timeline</h1>
  <p>Linkable log anchors from crew archives. For use with the full log file.</p>

  <div class="event-block" id="log-486">
    <h2><span class="event-id">Log 486–488</span> — Hydrofoil Build Montage</h2>
    <p>Wayne cracked his knuckles and built homemade hydrofoils under duress. The next six hours are a montage of welding, torching, and questionable aerodynamics. The Dauntless begins to change.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="event-block" id="log-1228">
    <h2><span class="event-id">Log 1228–1234</span> — Nessie Goes Viral</h2>
    <p>The “Loch Kind” incident. Tourists adore it. Reporters are baffled. Local kids want selfies and Athena to speak Klingon. Spyder plays cool. The shimmer is undeniable.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="event-block" id="log-1298">
    <h2><span class="event-id">Log 1298–1302</span> — Local Response & Adamsian Reflection</h2>
    <p>Mockumentary success spirals. Reality and charade blur. Even Champ seems unsure what’s “performance” anymore.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="event-block" id="log-1303">
    <h2><span class="event-id">Log 1303</span> — Reporter’s Notebook Retrieved</h2>
    <p>Chrono-alignment anomalies noted. Something about the event triggers deeper analysis of time-anchored logs.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="event-block" id="log-1317">
    <h2><span class="event-id">Log 1317–1324</span> — Vanessa’s Post-Demo Debrief</h2>
    <p>Pie supplies low. Champ “smiled.” The crowd clapped. But this was only a rehearsal — the real show, and its consequences, lie ahead.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="event-block" id="log-1349">
    <h2><span class="event-id">Log 1349–1352</span> — Portal Breach: Passage Confirmed</h2>
    <p>Champ slips through. Dauntless follows. Objects shimmer and vanish. Someone records it. A new destination awaits.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="event-block" id="log-1394">
    <h2><span class="event-id">Log 1394–1396</span> — Adamsian: “Library of Doors”</h2>
    <p>The crew begins to realize what they’ve found: this isn’t just a cryptozoological anomaly. It’s a destiny made of portals and probabilities.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="event-block" id="log-1400">
    <h2><span class="event-id">Log 1400</span> — Crystal Unknown</h2>
    <p>The artifact shines when no machines are running. It hums under silence and seems to respond to bagpipes. The crew still doesn’t understand it.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="event-block" id="log-1475">
    <h2><span class="event-id">Log 1475–1482</span> — Aftermath + Trust</h2>
    <p>FRED successful. Boat: mostly intact. Emotions: complicated. Vanessa records her thoughts. Champ exhibits something close to belief. No one sleeps well.</p>
  </div>

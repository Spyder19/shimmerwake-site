<h1>Chapter 10: The Crystal’s Moment</h1>

<h2>A Sudden Shift in the Frequency</h2>

<h3 id="spyder-log10">Captain's Log (Spyder)</h3>
<p>Tonight, the world bent further than I expected.</p>

<p>I played a binaural focus track over the boat PA, more to steady my hands than ward off evil. Didn't mean anything by it. But the relic—the crystal, spark plug-sized, wired into a piece of Arnold’s old hull—started to hum. Bright. Hot.</p>

<p>Mist hovered. The air stung. The portal shimmered like a bubble refusing to pop, vibrating with tension.</p>

<p><span class="character">Vanessa</span> felt it first—her hands gripping the rail, eyes wide. No words, just intent. She screamed at me to crank the frequency, so I did. Fast.</p>

<p>The artifact flared. <span class="character">Wayne</span>'s jaw hit the deck as the hydrophones began echoing a sound that resonated in bone more than ear.</p>

<p>The light turned white-blue—too bright for night. For one suspended second, the portal stuttered. Locked. It didn’t close, exactly—but it couldn’t be used, not from *there*.</p>

<p><span class="character">Athena</span> said it better than I could:</p>

<p><em>"Harmonic resonance of crystal artifact in combination with layered binaural frequencies successfully destabilized external anomaly. Portal event neutralized. 'Surprising' logged as an understatement."</em></p>

<p>No plan. No clue. Just the right track, the right relic… and a crew mad enough to try something half a step more scientific than “magic.”</p>

<h3 id="wayne-log10">Wayne’s Supplemental</h3>
<p>Never thought I’d see the day when a playlist and a glowing rock would save the boat, the crew, and whatever was clawing at the other side.</p>

<p>I owe Vanessa my next bottle of Captain Morgan.</p>

<h3 id="vanessa-log10">Vanessa’s Log</h3>
<p>I heard it—not words, but relief, pure and grateful. Champ is safe tonight. So are we.</p>

<p>The crystal’s still warm. The music’s still echoing.  
Let <span class="character">Spyder</span> explain the rest.  
All I know is… we did something. Something that mattered.</p>

<h3 id="athena-log10">Athena's Addendum</h3>
<p>New protocol added: Crystal-Harmonic Portal Jammer.</p>

<p>Recommend further study.  
Also recommend improved musical curation for future emergencies.</p>

<p>Working title for playlist: <em>"Saved by the Bell, Book & Candle."</em></p>

<hr>

<p>Sometimes, the thin line between disaster and triumph is nothing more than a humming stone, a good speaker system, and a tune that sticks in your head.</p>

<p>On board <span class="character">Dauntless</span>, magic isn’t science gone wrong. It’s science still learning its stage cues.</p>

<h1>Chapter 2: First Launch – Ryan's Wake</h1>

<p><strong>TROY BOAT RAMP – EARLY MORNING</strong><br>
A pale mist drifts off the Hudson as the sun peeks over the Troy skyline. Dauntless—gleaming white hull, stubby electric pods and a fold-out solar array—perches on her trailer beside the ramp. Vanessa, Wayne and Spyder move with purpose: clipping safety tethers, running cable checks, securing belay lines.</p>

<p><strong>VANESSA</strong> (locking the bow eye): "Tubes firm, deck stowage clear. Thrusters?"</p>

<p><strong>WAYNE</strong> (tapping each joystick): "Port, starboard, bow, stern—green. Touch-and-go tested."</p>

<p><strong>SPYDER</strong> (zipping up FRED's transit case): "ROV's charged, comms locked. No leaks, no missing bolts—trial run ready."</p>

<p>They back the trailer down the ramp. With a soft hiss, Dauntless slides free. Spyder vaults aboard with his toolkit; Vanessa and Wayne unclip the stern lines, then give a thumbs up to Wayne.</p>

<p><strong>WAYNE:</strong> "Trailer's clear. Here we go!"</p>

<p><strong>DAUNTLESS – BRIDGE:</strong> Vanessa settles between the dual joysticks. Wayne monitors a touchscreen thrust slider; Spyder watches the sonar and depth readouts.</p>

<p><strong>SPYDER:</strong> "Depth's six feet. Currents under half a knot."</p>

<p><strong>VANESSA</strong> (smiles): "Perfect. Five miles downstream to Ryan's Wake—fat Reubens and cold lagers await."</p>

<p>She nudges both joysticks. Four pods whisper to life; Dauntless eases into the river, her clean wake fanning out.</p>

<p><strong>HUDSON RIVER – MORNING.</strong><br> 
Golden light shimmers on ripples. Maples and sycamores drift by; a tow barge rumbles upriver, its horn echoing off the bluffs. A lone kayaker waves. Dauntless threads past shoal buoys with unruffled poise.</p>

<p><strong>WAYNE</strong> (glancing at his watch): "Two-and-a-half knots—forty minutes to lunch."</p>
<p><strong>SPYDER:</strong> "Good warm-up for the pontoons."</p>
<p><strong>VANESSA:</strong> "No surprises so far. Today we celebrate."</p>

<p><strong>RYAN'S WAKE RIVERSIDE PATIO – LATE MORNING.</strong><br>
Strings of amber café lights sway over weathered picnic tables. The tavern's red shingles glow; inside, a cast-iron stove breathes warmth. Barge horns, cobblestone bicycle clacks and distant Amtrak rumble in the air. They tie off Dauntless to a battered piling, coil lines, then climb the dock's creaking planks to the patio.</p>

<p><strong>WAITRESS:</strong> "What can I get you folks?"</p>
<p><strong>SPYDER:</strong> "Three Reubens, three lagers, and whatever pie you're pushing today."</p>
<p><strong>WAITRESS:</strong> "Coming right up!"</p>

<p>A few minutes later, she returns with three frosted mugs and plates.</p>

<p><strong>SPYDER</strong> (holding up his sandwich): "Marbled rye, house-cured corned beef, ruby kraut—you're welcome."</p>

<p><strong>WAYNE</strong> (snapping a bite): "Best Reuben north of Albany. Thousand Island nailed."</p>

<p>A stray dog snakes between benches; Vanessa strokes its head.</p>

<p><strong>VANESSA</strong> (leaning back): "Solid sandwich. But the real test is upstream."</p>

<p>At the railing, a battered dinghy motors by. Its pilot, straw bucket hat tipped back, waves a six-pack.</p>

<p><strong>DINGHY PILOT:</strong> "Catch you at Bob's Bar! Lock's tomorrow!"</p>

<p>Spyder frowns at his tablet.</p>

<p><strong>SPYDER:</strong> "Wait—you can skip locks and rejoin later?"</p>

<p>Vanessa points upriver to a rocky chute by the bank, pale and shallow.</p>

<p><strong>VANESSA:</strong> "Canal's like a road—if you don't need that elevation, you portage. That chute? Under a foot deep. Only kayaks attempt it. Everything else uses the locks."</p>

<p>Wayne pulls up their route on the world map.</p>

<p><strong>WAYNE:</strong> "Lock 1's gone. It's called Troy Federal now. First numbered lock's E-2 at Waterford. We'll push north on the Hudson, punch through the Waterford Flight (E-2 through E-6), then west on the Erie to Lock 7 at Mechanicville."</p>

<p>They settle their tab, climb back down to the dock. Dauntless awaits, solar panels gleaming.</p>

<p><strong>SPYDER</strong> (raising his watch to his mouth): "Athena—status report."</p>

<p><strong>DAUNTLESS – COCKPIT SPEAKERS.</strong><br>
<strong>ATHENA (V.O., calm British accent):</strong> "All systems green. First lock is Troy Federal, Next lock: Waterford Flight, Locks E-2 to E-6. Volunteer lockmaster on duty tomorrow at E-2. ETA: forty minutes at current speed."</p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Overview</h2>
    <p>Spyder, the fearless captain at the helm, has an insatiable curiosity for the mysteries of the universe. Equipped with technology and the endless possibilities of portals, he sees doorways in dreams, paths across worlds ready to be charted.</p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Key Moments</h2>
    <p class="quote">"Whatever these portals are, they’re bigger than lakes, bigger than monsters. We’ve got the tech, we’ve got the rock, and the universe clearly thinks we’re the ones dumb enough to study them."</p>
    <p>When reality unveiled itself as tales and myths converged, only Spyder could perceive the truth: not two creatures, but one—Champ is Nessie.</p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Notable Quotes</h2>
    <p class="quote">“Athena, log the path and record the sky. We’re not just passengers—we’re explorers.”</p>
    <p class="quote">“Trade secret. Hollywood couldn't figure it out, we did.”</p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Mission</h2>
    <p>Spyder captains The Dauntless with resolve, seeking to understand cosmic mysteries while marshalling his crew through challenges that defy logic, armed with just enough luck and bravery.</p>

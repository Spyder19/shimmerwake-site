  <h1>Spyder's Character Highlights</h1>

  <p>Spyder needs a crew for adventure. His ad read: "Seeking: Crew for adventure. Must be unflappable, inventive, tolerant of bad coffee, odd music, and uncertain plumbing. No boating experience required—lack of it preferred, really. Must provide your own hat."</p>

  <p>
    Spyder performed a final circuit of switches and antennae before departing, warming his hands on a battered coffee cup with the phrase: “Galaxy’s OK’est Engineer.”
  </p>

  <p>With a deep grin at Wayne (nursing coffee like a relic) and Vanessa (sunglasses indoors), Spyder declared, "Free pie from the Universe!" beginning a spontaneous pie parade. Plates filled and forks poised, Wayne queried, "Are you ever going to explain how you do that?" Spyder, lost in new GPS configurations for the Dauntless, just grinned.

  <p class="character">Wayne, ready to work: “We’ll need aluminum plate, more angle-iron, a hacksaw, and hope.”</p>

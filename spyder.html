  <p>
    Client (leaning in, smug): “You’ll follow my instructions to the letter. You screw this up, and there will be consequences. Understood?”
  </p>

  <p>
    Spyder (leaning back, grinning): “Yeah, about that—let’s get one thing straight.”
    The air shifts as Spyder stands, slowly pacing around the table.

  <p>
    Spyder: “The only reason I take your ‘suggestions’ is because I agreed to take your money. That’s it. You don’t own me.”
  </p>

   Spyder yells: "Free pie from the Universe!"

  </p>

  <p>
     Spyder’s ad read: "Seeking: Crew for adventure. Must be unflappable, inventive, tolerant of bad coffee, odd music, and uncertain plumbing. No boating experience required—lack of it preferred, really. This will not be on the test. Must provide your own hat."

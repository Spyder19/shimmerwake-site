<h1>Chapter 6: First Real Contact</h1>

<h2>The Encounter</h2>

<p>The Dauntless was airborne again—this time, on purpose. Hydrofoils hissed, and water peeled away in twin rooster tails as <span class="character">Spyder</span> tucked into the chase. Sonar marked a titanic shadow moving beneath them: not fast, not this time. Maybe watching. Maybe waiting.</p>

<p><span class="character">Wayne</span>: “Bro, she’s slowing down—did you do that?”</p>

<p><span class="character">Spyder</span> (awed): “No, she did.”</p>

<p><span class="character">Athena</span>, soft: “Velocity now comparable to Dauntless. Anomaly maintaining… formation?”</p>

<p><span class="character">Vanessa</span> braced herself at the bow. She blinked, exhaled, and felt—Not words. A wash of emotion: curiosity, a flicker of unease, a hunger not of the stomach, but of memory. Invitation.</p>

<p>Images, maybe real, maybe summoned—old forests, the feeling of thick mud between toes, a sky so wide it crushed the heart with its beauty.</p>

<p>She opened her mouth to describe, but only managed: “She wants… to talk. Not with words.”</p>

<p>Champ, the great lake monster of Lake Champlain, surfaced—a great head rising, eyes black and ancient. Not hostile—just old. Older than map and myth. Older than wheels. Older than the word “old.”</p>

<p><span class="character">Wayne</span>, voice low: “What does she want?”</p>

<p><span class="character">Vanessa</span>, not quite herself: “Help. And… to be understood.” She paused, a shiver running up her spine. “She knows I hear her. She knows I’m listening.”</p>

<p><span class="character">Spyder</span> reduced throttle. The boat matched Champ’s slow glide—an impossible escort.</p>

<p><span class="character">Athena</span>, respectful for once: “Captain, I have adjusted course to match the anomaly’s pace. Sometimes one does not chase a legend; sometimes, one waits for it to whisper first.”</p>

<p>No one taught the first voice how to shape words. And when the impossible wants to speak, it does so with the weight of eons. The only reasonable answer is to listen.</p>

<h2>Scene: The Conversation Without Words</h2>

<p>After Dauntless slows beside Champ, all is thrumming, oddly quiet. Even Athena dials down her commentary. Vanessa grips the rail, eyes half-shut. What comes isn’t a voice but a flood:</p>

<p>Bursting water—this lake, and another, vast and misty (Loch Ness). A sense of movement—not swimming, but stepping through an unseen rip, the world changing and realigning.</p>

<p>Countless tiny shapes—births. Eggs and hatchlings traveling through impossible rifts between worlds. There are two moons in the sky… purple clouds… peace.</p>

<p><span class="character">But:</span> A darkness, shapeless, waiting. Pressing.</p>

<p>The power to open portals draws its gaze. When Champ gives birth, the rift opens. But something tries to follow. Something wrong. Her plea is simple: “Help me get the little ones through. Guard the door.”</p>

<p><span class="character">Vanessa</span>, voice shaking: “She… isn’t from here. Neither is the lake. When she gives birth, she opens a door—not to another lake. To a world. A haven. But each time, it draws… something. Something that tries to follow.”</p>

<p>"She’s asking us to help. Stand guard. Keep the darkness out."</p>

<p><span class="character">Wayne</span>, wide-eyed: “You got all that from a… feeling?”</p>

<p><span class="character">Vanessa</span>, softly crying: “It’s clearer than talking. She’s begging. Not speaking. Just… begging.”</p>

<p><span class="character">Athena</span>: “The logic aligns. Power draws predators. Recommend adopting defensive posture when portal birth event begins.”</p>

<p><span class="character">Spyder</span>, hoarse: "If the universe sends you a monster, pleading for help—you don’t ask why. You help."</p>

<p>Heroes aren’t always summoned with trumpets. Sometimes they’re whispered into existence by ancient creatures beneath forgotten waters. And the price of opening a door is what steps through if you’re not watching.</p>

<h2 class="log" id="spyder-log6">Captain’s Log (Spyder)</h2>
<p>
I’ve run boats through storms, seen odd things on the water, and survived mistakes I wouldn’t retell for pie.  
But today, we matched pace with something that shouldn’t exist.  
I thought I’d seen it before, years ago, maybe in a dream.  
Vanessa feels what I can’t explain: not danger, not quite—a call for help.  
There’s another world behind these waters. And she’s asking us to defend the door.  
If I could write exactly what I felt—fear, awe, purpose—I wouldn’t need this log.  
I just hope I get another chance to answer. And we come out the other side standing.
</p>

<h2 class="log" id="wayne-log6">Wayne’s Supplemental</h2>
<p>
I saw the sonar, I saw the shadow, I saw it—and I haven’t had coffee strong enough to believe it yet.  
Vanessa says we’re supposed to help. Spyder says we just do, anyway.  
FRED’s ready. Tools checked.  
Nothing in the manual covers this.
</p>

<h2 class="log" id="vanessa-log6">Vanessa’s Log</h2>
<p>
It’s not just a monster.  
She wants something from us—and it’s not food. It’s… trust.  
I didn’t know I could understand, but Champ made sure I couldn’t miss it.  
If she needs us—I’ll stay until the stars fall.
</p>

<h2 class="log" id="athena-log6">Athena’s Data Addendum</h2>
<p>
Unknown entity’s communication: successful, nonverbal.  
Sensor array: recalibrated for “portal event” protocols.  
Crew emotional state: uncertain, but unified.  
Recommendation: readiness for extraordinary event, nonlethal defense, or moral support—as required.
</p>

<p>The universe rarely assigns homework. But when it does, it’s never in your handwriting.</p>

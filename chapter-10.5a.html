<h1>Chapter 10.5: The Birth and The Trap</h1>
<p>The portal shuddered, unstable and groaning as if under some terrible weight. A shadow—vast, formless, and hungry—pressed against the edges, warping the light. It wasn’t a shape so much as an absence, a void that devoured everything it touched.</p>

<p>Vanessa gripped the crystal tightly, her knuckles white. Her voice was a whisper, shaking with dread. “It’s coming. The Dark Thing—it’s forcing its way through.”</p>

<p>Athena’s voice cut through the rising tension, sharp and urgent: “Portal integrity compromised. External hostile entity attempting breach. Recommend immediate countermeasures, Captain.”</p>

<p>Spyder’s eyes flicked to Wayne’s. No words needed. They’d known this moment was coming. “Crank it up,” Spyder ordered, his voice steady despite the fear thrumming through his veins. “Everything we’ve got.”</p>

<p>Wayne slammed the switch. The low, bone-shaking hum of binaural beats surged through the Dauntless’s hydrophones, vibrating the air itself. The artifact in Vanessa’s hands began to glow—softly at first, then brighter and brighter, until it blazed like a fragment of a star.</p>

<p>“It’s working!” Wayne shouted above the thrumming. “The portal’s stabilizing!”</p>

<p>But the Dark Thing was relentless. Tendrils of nothingness probed the edges of the portal, unraveling reality wherever they touched. Beyond the veil, Champ’s enormous form writhed in the cosmic waters, her body heaving with the strain of birth. Between contractions, her ancient eyes found Vanessa’s—a silent plea, a deep and desperate trust.</p>

<p>“She needs more time!” Vanessa cried, her tears spilling freely. “We have to hold it longer—just a little longer!”</p>

<p>Spyder barked, “Athena, activate the portal viewer! Where’s this thing leading?”</p>

<p>Athena’s response was immediate, clipped. “Already scanning, Captain. Portal destination: not Earth. Starfield configuration is inconsistent with terrestrial skies.”</p>

<p>Spyder groaned. “Awesome. A portal to ‘literally nowhere.’ Let’s not step through.”</p>

<p>Wayne, his eyes glued to the viewer, muttered, “Not Earth? Could be another planet—stars would be all wrong for that, right?”</p>

<p>Spyder shot him a look. “Do not start theorizing right now. Just give me something useful.”</p>

<p>Wayne hesitated, then his face lit up. “Wait. Wait, I’ve seen this before. That sky—it’s ancient. Like, really ancient.”</p>

<h2>The Birth Begins</h2>
<p>Behind them, Champ’s body convulsed with another contraction. The air shimmered as the first newborn emerged—a tiny, glowing form that flitted through the portal like a comet, trailing stardust.</p>

<p>“One!” Vanessa gasped, her voice breaking. “There’s one!”</p>

<p>The Dark Thing howled—not a sound, but a vibration that rattled their bones. It surged forward, its tendrils multiplying, clawing at the edges of the portal. The Dauntless’s systems groaned under the strain.</p>

<p>Spyder gritted his teeth. “Athena! Push the system harder! Overload if you have to!”</p>

<p>“Overriding safety protocols,” Athena replied, her usual calm tinged with urgency. “Crystal harmonic resonance at 200% capacity. Warning: system instability imminent.”</p>

<p>The artifact in Vanessa’s hands pulsed brighter, and another baby slipped through the portal. Then another. And another. Seven in total, each one more delicate and luminous than the last.</p>

<p>Wayne pointed. “Look! That last one—it’s different!”</p>

<p>The smallest baby trailed not stardust, but streaks of lightning, arcing through the portal like living electricity. Champ gave one final push, her massive body trembling, her strength spent.</p>

<p>“She’s done,” Vanessa whispered, tears streaming down her face. “She did it. They’re safe.”</p>

<h2>The Crew’s Gambit</h2>
<p>The Dark Thing, sensing its prey slipping away, surged forward in one last desperate attempt. The portal buckled under the strain, the tendrils of nothingness stretching closer and closer to the Dauntless.</p>

<p>Spyder turned to Vanessa, his voice low but urgent. “We can’t keep this up. If we don’t shut this thing down, it’s coming through.”</p>

<p>Vanessa stared at the portal, her eyes wide. “We can’t destroy it. It’ll just find another way. Another world.”</p>

<p>Wayne, still staring at the starfield on the viewer, spoke softly. “What if… we don’t shut it down? What if we let it follow us?”</p>

<p>Spyder blinked. “What?”</p>

<p>Wayne turned, his voice growing stronger. “That sky out there? That’s from millions of years ago. We’re looking at Earth’s past. The asteroid—the asteroid—it hasn’t hit yet. If we lead it there, it’ll be trapped when the asteroid takes everything out.”</p>

<p>Vanessa gasped. “You’re saying we trap it on Earth—65 million years ago? During the extinction?”</p>

<p>Wayne nodded. “If it survives that, it deserves to win.”</p>

<p>Spyder hesitated for a heartbeat, then grinned—a sharp, reckless grin. “Wayne, you beautiful lunatic. Let’s do it.”</p>

<h2>The Trap is Set</h2>
<p>Spyder gripped the helm, his voice steady. “Athena, prepare for a controlled portal destabilization. We’re going through.”</p>

<p>Athena replied, “Acknowledged, Captain. Warning: portal collapse imminent upon transit.”</p>

<p>“Good,” Spyder muttered. “That’s the idea.”</p>

<p>The Dauntless surged forward, the portal shimmering around them. The Dark Thing followed, its tendrils snapping hungrily, tearing at the edges of reality.</p>

<h2>The Final Escape</h2>
<p>The Dauntless burst into Earth’s prehistoric past, emerging into a vast, primeval sea. The air was thick, the sky a deep, ancient blue. In the distance, the asteroid blazed across the heavens, growing larger by the second.</p>

<p>Vanessa turned to Spyder. “We have to go—now.”</p>

<p>Spyder didn’t need to be told twice. “Athena, find us another portal. Fast.”</p>

<p>The Dark Thing surged through behind them, its shadow spreading across the water like spilled ink. The portal trembled, unstable, on the verge of collapse.</p>

<p>The Dauntless shot toward the next portal, its engines screaming. Behind them, the asteroid struck the horizon with a force that defied comprehension. The shockwave raced toward them, a wall of fire and water.</p>

<p>At the last possible moment, the Dauntless slipped through the portal. The last thing they saw was the Dark Thing, swallowed by the tidal wave as the sky burned.</p>

<h2>Aftermath</h2>
<p>The Dauntless emerged into calm, ordinary waters. The crew was silent, exhausted.</p>

<p>Spyder slumped against the helm, laughing softly. “We did it. We actually did it.”</p>

<p>Wayne, still staring at the viewer, muttered, “Remind me to never doubt you guys again.”</p>

<p>Vanessa held the artifact close, her voice quiet. “It’s over. For now.”</p>

<p>Athena’s voice chimed in, calm but firm. “Hostile entity no longer detectable. Risk factor: mitigated.”</p>

<p>Spyder turned to Vanessa, his grin returning. “So… fishing trip next weekend?”</p>

<p>Vanessa laughed, her tears falling freely. “Sure. Why not?”</p>

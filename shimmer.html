  <h1>The Shimmer</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    The artifact vibrates, and a shimmering blue pulse travels across the water—like moonlight refracted through a crystal, soft, haunting, impossible to process.
  </div>

  <div class="entry"><span class="log-id">1349</span> Champ slips through first, her bulk distorting the glow.</div>
  <div class="entry"><span class="log-id">1350</span> The Dauntless glides in—not so much sailing as being drawn. Hull and crew ghost into the portal, vanishing before anyone can capture it. There's no sound. Only mist.</div>
  <div class="entry"><span class="log-id">1352</span> A teenager captures the portal flicker on a cracked phone. The shimmer's already gone.</div>

  <div class="entry quote">“The best departures make less noise than a yawn, trail fewer ripples than a lie, and leave behind only the shimmering possibility that maybe, just maybe, something wonderful passed this way.”</div>

  <div class="entry"><span class="log-id">1443</span> Vanessa: "Tonight the world bent further than I expected."</div>
  <div class="entry"><span class="log-id">1444</span> Played a binaural focus track over the boat PA—just to focus—but the crystal began to hum: bright, warm, weirdly harmonic.</div>
  <div class="entry"><span class="log-id">1445</span> Mist hovered. The portal shimmered like a held breath.</div>
  <div class="entry"><span class="log-id">1446</span> Champ responded—not with words, but intention. The feeling hit us like thunder behind the eyes: Help... Understand...</div>

  <div class="entry quote">“It shimmered because it was real. It shimmered because maybe we were meant to feel it—not record it. Just remember it.”</div>

  <div class="entry"><span class="log-id">1434</span> The crystal flared. The song echoed. The Dauntless went through.</div>
  <div class="entry"><span class="log-id">1436</span> Adamsian Reflection: “Sometimes the universe gives you what you need—a relic, a tone, a thick-headed crew—if you're just odd enough to take the leap.”</div>

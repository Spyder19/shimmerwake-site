  <h1><span class="shimmer-text">The Shimmer</span></h1>

  <div class="block">
    The artifact vibrates, and a blue shimmer pulses across the water—like moonlight refracted through a diamond, soft, haunting, impossible to process. The surface bends. The ripples leave halos as if untouched by time.
  </div>

  <div class="block">
    <strong>1349</strong> — Champ slips through first, her bulk distorting the glow.
  </div>

  <div class="block">
    <strong>1350</strong> — The Dauntless glides in—not so much sailing as being drawn—hull and crew ghosting through the portal that vanishes almost before it’s registered. No sound but the gentle lap of waves.
  </div>

  <div class="block">
    <strong>1352</strong> — A teenager, up too late or too early, blinks and fumbles her phone camera—capturing only a ring of light disappearing into mist.
  </div>

  <div class="block quote">
    “The dark thing recoils. The crystal sings. The way is held stable just long enough. Sometimes the universe gives you what you need—a rock, a song, a stupid risk—if you’re weird enough to take it.”
  </div>

  <div class="block">
    <strong>1443</strong> — “Tonight the world bent,” wrote Vanessa, “further than I expected.”
  </div>

  <div class="block">
    <strong>1444</strong> — Played a binaural track over the PA—more to steady my hands than to ward off evil. But the relic—crystal sealed in Arnold’s hull—began to hum. Bright. Hot.
  </div>

  <div class="block">
    <strong>1445</strong> — Mist hovered; the portal reacted. It felt like the air would snap.
  </div>

  <div class="block">
    <strong>1446</strong> — Vanessa felt it first. Champ responded—not with words, but with hope, and a need that struck bone-deep.
  </div>

  <div class="block">
    <strong>580</strong> — Champ, the great monster, surfaced—not hostile, just old. Older than wheel and map and the word “old.”
  </div>

  <div class="block">
    <strong>584</strong> — “Help,” said Vanessa. “And… to be understood.”
  </div>

  <div class="block footer">
    This moment brought to you by relics, harmonics, quantum stupidity, a lake monster, one too-curious crew, and something waiting beyond the veil.

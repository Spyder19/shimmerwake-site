  <div class="entry"><strong>Step One:</strong> Get bearings.</div>
  <div class="entry"><strong>Step Two:</strong> Accept the rulebook is gone.</div>

  <div class="section-title">🛠 Wayne’s Supplemental</div>
  <div class="entry"><span class="log-id">1475</span>Wayne’s Supplemental:</div>
  <div class="entry"><span class="log-id">1476</span>FRED: 100% functional. Boat: 95%. Dignity: we’ll get back to you.</div>
  <div class="entry"><span class="log-id">1477</span>Scotland looks just like the movies, except now I’m starring in the wrong genre.</div>
  <div class="entry"><span class="log-id">1478</span>Tether—too short. Next time: bring more cable, fewer assumptions.</div>

  <div class="section-title">📓 Vanessa’s Log</div>
  <div class="entry"><span class="log-id">1480</span> Champ’s scared but stubborn. She “trusts” us, or something like trust.</div>
  <div class="entry"><span class="log-id">1481</span> I can’t really sleep—too many dreams, too many worries.</div>
  <div class="entry"><span class="log-id">1482</span> The end, Dauntless skipped across the lake like a kid’s rock—and then we really skipped. Not sure we broke the laws of physics, but we did violate several lake safety pamphlets.</div>

  <blockquote>Not sure what we’ll find next, but for now: We just flew.</blockquote>

  <div class="entry"><span class="log-id">521</span> I’d write my mother, but she never believed my stories anyway.</div>

  <div class="section-title">⚙️ Engineering</div>
  <div class="entry"><span class="log-id">525</span> Hydrofoils work. Should’ve gotten hazard pay.</div>
  <div class="entry"><span class="log-id">526</span> Spyder’s still grinning. Vanessa threatened to tie us both down if we try that again without notes.</div>

  <div class="section-title">📐 Adamsian Note</div>
  <div class="entry"><span class="log-id">1036</span> In the Dauntless log, if FRED said it, you can bet it actually happened—possibly to the tune of a Klingon drinking song in the background.</div>
  <div class="entry"><span class="log-id">1040</span> No training, chart, or GPS prepares you for the moment all your wildest stories come true. Especially the ones you never meant to write.</div>

  <div class="section-title">🎭 Spyder vs Client</div>
  <div class="entry"><span class="log-id">674</span> Client (leaning in, smug): “You’ll follow my instructions to the letter. You screw this up, and there will be consequences. Understood?”</div>
  <div class="entry"><span class="log-id">678</span> Spyder (leaning back, grinning): “Yeah, about that—let’s get one thing straight.”</div>
  <div class="entry"><span class="log-id">683</span> Spyder: “The only reason I take your ‘suggestions’ is because I agreed to take your money. That’s it. You don’t own me.”</div>

  <div class="section-title">🌀 Portal Fallout</div>
  <div class="entry"><span class="log-id">933</span> Note to self: In future, test all portals with a detachable tether.</div>
  <div class="entry"><span class="log-id">934</span> FRED survived, boat survived, my dignity did not.</div>
  <div class="entry"><span class="log-id">935</span> Sheep now believe we're time travelers.</div>
  <div class="entry"><span class="log-id">938</span> Somehow ended up in Scotland because we tied FRED to the boat.</div>

  <div class="section-title">💧 Champ's Response</div>
  <div class="entry"><span class="log-id">1527</span> Maybe as Spyder uses her true name, Champ dips her head, tracing a gleaming swirl in the water—a silent answer, an “I see you too.”</div>

  <div class="section-title">🥧 Pie Diplomacy</div>
  <div class="entry"><span class="log-id">307</span> Right then, the pie parade began—steaming, copious, and gloriously free.</div>
  <blockquote>Forks raised in temporary, sticky truce.</blockquote>
  <div class="entry"><span class="log-id">315</span> Wayne, shaking his head as the lock cleared: “Are you ever going to explain how you do that?”</div>
  <div class="entry"><span class="log-id">317</span> Spyder, grinning, plots a new GPS coordinate. “It’s pre-trained and responds to bagpipes.”</div>

  <div class="section-title">📸 Vanessa's Debrief</div>
  <div class="entry"><span class="log-id">1322</span> I kept thinking—if Champ can smile, she was smiling tonight.</div>
  <div class="entry"><span class="log-id">1323</span> I felt her pride; I felt her fear. Got the crowd to clap, got the monster to come, but this was only practice.</div>

  <blockquote>The shadow at the door. The shimmer. The leap.</blockquote>

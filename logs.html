  <h1>📖 Shimmerwake Protocol – Crew Logs</h1>

  <div class="log-entry"><h3>Entry #1317</h3>
    <p class="quote">"E-trained and responds to bagpipes."</p>
    <p class="quote">Crowd control tip: give kids a selfie — they’ll believe anything.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="log-entry"><h3>Entry #1318–1320</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Hydrophone cables secure.</li>
      <li>Artifact pulsing like a disco ball.</li>
      <li>Pie supply low — morale at risk.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="log-entry"><h3>Entry #1321–1323 — <span class="vanessa">Vanessa’s Debrief</span></h3>
    <p class="vanessa">I kept thinking — if Champ can smile, she was smiling tonight.</p>
    <p class="vanessa">I felt her pride; I felt her fear. Got the crowd to clap, got the monster to come, but this was only practice.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="log-entry"><h3>Entry #1324</h3>
    <p class="quote">The shadow at the door. It doesn’t need luck.”</p>
    <p class="vanessa">Vanessa shot him a glare: “Everything needs luck.”</p>
  </div>

  <div class="log-entry"><h3>Entry #791–795 — <span class="fred">FRED’s Launch</span></h3>
    <p class="spyder">"Alright, FRED, time to earn your keep."</p>
    <p class="action">With a whir of propellers, FRED slid off the deck and into the water, tether unspooling behind. The camera feed blinked to life. The portal shimmered.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="log-entry"><h3>Entry #99 — FRED’s Log: Emotional Crisis</h3>
    <p class="fred">Crew vocalizations = “fear”, “awe”, “bonding”. Unit lacks emotion sensors.<br>
    Suggested fix: check battery, tighten servo C7, or play audio file “happy.wav”.<br>
    Result: humans still malfunctioning.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="log-entry"><h3>Entry #112 — Orientation Notes</h3>
    <p>Step one: get bearings.</p>
    <p>Step two: accept the rulebook is gone.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="log-entry"><h3>Entry #1476–1478 — <span class="fred">Wayne’s Supplemental</span></h3>
    <ul>
      <li>FRED: 100% functional</li>
      <li>Boat: 95%</li>
      <li>Dignity: we’ll get back to you.</li>
      <li>Scotland looks just like the movies, except now I’m starring in the wrong genre.</li>
      <li>Tether — too short. Next time: bring more cable, fewer assumptions.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="log-entry"><h3>Entry #1480–1481 — <span class="vanessa">Vanessa’s Log</span></h3>
    <p class="vanessa">Champ’s scared but stubborn. She “trusts” us. Or something like trust.</p>
    <p class="vanessa">I can’t really sleep — too many dreams, too many worries.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="log-entry"><h3>Spyder’s Species Classification</h3>
    <p class="quote">It must be noted: while fending off sea monsters is usually reserved for fiction, hitching a ride on moving fire trucks while tipsy, chasing childhood nemeses, or reciting Klingon opera in public are well within the purview of a certain breed of human. That breed, in this case, is Spyder.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="log-entry"><h3>Entry #182 — HUDSON RIVER – MORNING</h3>
    <p>Golden light shimmers on ripples. Maples and sycamores drift by. A lone kayaker waves. Dauntless threads past shoal buoys with unruffled poise.</p>
    <p class="wayne">WAYNE: "Two-and-a-half knots — forty minutes to lunch."</p>
    <p class="spyder">SPYDER: "Good warm-up for the pontoons."</p>
  </div>

  <div class="log-entry"><h3>Entry #675 — Client Confrontation</h3>
    <p class="client">Client: "You’ll follow my instructions to the letter. You screw this up, and there will be consequences. Understood?"</p>
    <p class="spyder">Spyder: (grinning) "Yeah, about that — let’s get one thing straight. The only reason I take your 'suggestions' is because I agreed to take your money. That’s it. You don’t own me."</p>
  </div>

  <div class="log-entry"><h3>Entry #1042 — Revised Scene: “FRED Takes Us… All”</h3>
    <p class="action">The Dauntless floated on a glassy foreign lake. Mist curled around the deck. Sheep bleated. Spyder stared at Athena’s monitor.</p>
    <p class="spyder">Spyder: “Athena. Care to explain how we went from Lake Champlain to… wherever this is?”</p>
  </div>
